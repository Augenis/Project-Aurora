### Events ###
afg.0.t:0 "The 5th Anglo-Afghan War?"
afg.0.d:0 "In the remnants of the Raj to our south, dissent has sprung up like wildflowers in the wake of Edward VIII's succession. In Kabul, we have our own troubles keeping the latent discontent of reform down. A repeat of the victorious Fourth Anglo-Afghan War might cement our own position whilst winning new lands and subjects for the crown!"
afg.0.a:0 "The time is ripe! Let us repeat our victories!"
afg.0.b:0 "What does India have but cows?"

afg.1.t:0 "The Third Treaty of Rawalpindi"
afg.1.d:0 "Catastrophe! Our campaign against the Delhi Government has been crowned with spectacular failure and our armies forced through the Pass of Khyber, fleeing in panic. The vice-roy, Ganga Singh, has offered peace - demanding a restoration of the pre-1926 borders. Unfortunately we are unable to decline, lest our very nation be destroyed..."
afg.1.d.puppet:0 "Catastrophe! Our campaign against the Delhi Government has been crowned with spectacular failure and our armies forced through the Pass of Khyber, fleeing in panic. The vice-roy, Ganga Singh, has offered peace - demanding a restoration of the pre-1926 borders and the permanent submission of our government to theirs. Unfortunately we are unable to decline, lest our very nation be destroyed..."
afg.1.a:0 "We yield because we have no other choice..."

afg.2.t:0 "The Third Treaty of Rawalpindi"
afg.2.d:0 "Victory is ours! The decadent British lapdogs in Delhi have been utterly routed and our forces are entrenched in the smouldering remains of their capital. Now might be the best time to demand concessions, whilst we still carry the lead."
afg.2.a:0 "Let us claim Kashmir and carve a path to the Mouth of the Indus!"
afg.2.b:0 "I shall be the emancipator and liberator of all Mohammedans in the Indus Valley!"
afg.2.c:0 "No peace with idol-worshippers, let us complete our conquest!"

afg.3.t:0 "Demands of the Emir"
afg.3.d:0 "Curses! The Afghan dogs have completely overpowered us and have reduced our proud nation to humiliation. Now the Afghan Emir demands our surrender of the princely state of Kashmir and access to the Mouth of the Indus. Although these are harsh terms, it might be wise to comply - lest our rivals on the continent act on our exposed situation."
afg.3.a:0 "We yield because we have no other choice..."
afg.3.b:0 "They must be joking, Hindustan Zindabad!"

afg.4.t:0 "The Delhi Government Refuses!"
afg.4.d:0 "Foolishly, the British lapdogs have refused our rightful claims."
afg.4.a:0 "The war continues!"

afg.5.t:0 "Shia Muslims Flee The War"
afg.5.d:0 "For decades the situation of the Shia minority in Afghanistan have been bad, the post-war situation wasn't gold, and another war could possibly only make it worse. Shia imams in the provinces of Herat and Farah have encouraged the shia minority to flee into their friendly neighbour Persia. Let's hope the Persians send them back, we need that manpower."
afg.5.a:0 "Traitors!"

afg.6.t:0 "Refugees from Afghanistan"
afg.6.d:0 "Yet another war has started between Afghanistan and Dehli. The Shia minority in Afghanistan fears this will only make their situation worse, therefor they have decided to start a new life here, however this situation might be more problematic then what we think. If we accept these people into our nation the government of Afghanistan will be deeply upset with us."
afg.6.a:0 "They shall be more than welcome, settle them in Mashad!"
afg.6.b:0 "This would be meddling in Afghan domestic politics, refuse them!"

afg.7.t:0 "Persia Closes Its Borders"
afg.7.d:0 "The Persians made the right choice and sent our people back home"
afg.7.a:0 "Hurrah!"

afg.8.t:0 "Domestic Reaction to Afghan Defeat"
afg.8.d:0 "The defeat of our armies has sent shock waves through Afghanistan! Our secret service reports huge dissatisfaction with the royal government amongst both the peasants and the army! Even worse radical clerics are drumming up support for a general insurrection against the royal reform programme! These are truly dark times for our small kingdom."
afg.8.a:0 "The King can do as he likes! Suppress any rebellion!"
afg.8.b:0 "Habibullah Kalakani raises the flag of Islamic revolt!"
afg.8.c:0 "Mohammed Nadir deposes Amanullah and proclaims himself king!"

afg.9.t:0 "Order in Afghanistan"
afg.9.d:0 "Afghanistan cannot into revolt."
afg.9.a:0 "Here's to hoping for a better tomorrow."

afg.10.t:0 "Afghanistan in Chaos!"
afg.10.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, rebel forces have pushed the troops of king Amanullah out of Kabul and are in effect in control of the country!"
afg.10.a:0 "Habibullah Kalakani's troops triumph by Islamic virtue!"
afg.10.b:0 "General Nadir's brigades defeat all opposition and proclaim him king!"

afg.11.t:0 "The Foreign Relations of the Emirate of Afghanistan"
afg.11.d:0 "Habibullah Kalakani has finally brought Islamic order to the people of Afghanistan and established himself as the undisputed ruler of our nation. After our defeat by the Indian government, his majesty has proposed to court the Islamic Federation of Turkestan for an alliance to safeguard us from further military conflict with the Indians."
afg.11.a:0 "Let us align with the Islamic Federation of Turkestan!"
afg.11.b:0 "As long as the country lies in ruins, we can't engage in foreign policy."

afg.12.t:0 "Alliance Negotiations with the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan"
afg.12.d:0 "In Afghanistan, the degenerate monarchy of Amanullah has been overthrown by an Islamic revolt spearheaded by Habibullah Kalakani. Finally in total control of the country, Habibullah has approached us with an offer of alliance, hoping that the might of the Islamic Federation will dissuade enemies both foreign and domestic from attempting to overthrow his most righteous regime."
afg.12.a:0 "A most righteous proposition! We accept!"
afg.12.b:0 "We shan't have anything to do with usurpers!"

afg.13.t:0 "Formation of the Bukhara-Kabul Pact"
afg.13.d:0 "Today, delegations from both Afghanistan and Turkestan met in Bukhara to formalise a binding treaty of alliance between the two nations. Glory to the people of God! Takbir!"
afg.13.a:0 "Who can withstand the faithful when the faithful are united ?"

afg.14.t:0 "Mohammed Nadir Shah's Claim to the Throne"
afg.14.d:0 "Having assumed the throne through not so cordial methods and despite his relation to the royal family, Mohammed Nadir Shah desperately needs legitimacy to shore up his regime. It is suggested that his majesty convey a 'loya jirga' (grand assembly) of Pashtun leaders to confirm his ascension."
afg.14.a:0 "Call a loya jirga to confirm my ascension!"

afg.15.t:0 "Mohammed Nadir Shah and the Loya Jirga"
afg.15.d:0 "Speaking before the Grand Assembly of tribal leaders, Nadir Shah hopes to receive enough support to continue his rule unhindered."
afg.15.a:0 "The assembly hails Mohammed Nadir as king!"
afg.15.b:0 "The assembly denounces Mohammed Nadir!"

afg.16.t:0 "Nadir Shah's Royal Oligarchy"
afg.16.d:0 "With the war-torn country finally resembling some kind of order, Nadir Shah has resolved to reorganise his cabinet to secure continued stability for Afghanistan. Packing the government with relatives would be the obvious way to bind the state apparatus to Nadir's ambitions, but reaching out to some of Amanullah's supporters might also bridge a wide gap between the radical and moderate reformists."
afg.16.a:0 "Let my younger brother, Shah Wali Khan, enforce my will!"
afg.16.b:0 "My brother, Muhammed Hashim, will head the government!"
afg.16.c:0 "The meek academic Muhammed Ghobar shall 'lead' the cabinet!"
afg.16.e:0 "Woo Ammanulah's clique and appoint Abdul Hadi Dawai!"
afg.16.f:0 "Total royal control! I shall solely wield all executive power!"

afg.17.t:0 "Status of Amanullah's Reforms"
afg.17.d:0 "Mohammed Nadir Shah has taken control of our shaken nation after the failure of Amanullah Khan to enforce Afghan progress. Well aware that a great contributing factor of his predecessor's downfall was the speed of his westernisation reforms, Nadir Shah none the less has to address the great issue of rebuilding Afghanistan."
afg.17.a:0 "Discontinue social reform, but galvanise the improvement of our infrastructure!"
afg.17.b:0 "Cave in to the traditionalists and abandon all pretence of modernity!"
afg.17.c:0 "I shall succeed where Amanullah failed and bring Afghanistan into the modern world!"

afg.18.t:0 "Sarrafs have left Afghanistan"
afg.18.d:0 "Sarrafs are a group of Indian merchants who travel between Afghanistan and Delhi, exchanging money and trading goods in both of them. Our economy hardly depends on their visits. Now, the war has come and borders are safe no more. Only a few of these sarrafs are brave enough to continue trading with us. With most of their caravan are gone we now suffer from economical crisis."
afg.18.a:0 "We don't need these Indian dogs anyway!"

afg.19.t:0 "Sarrafs returns"
afg.19.d:0 "The war is over and borders are now safe. Nothing more disturb the sarrafs now and the first wave of them already resumed their tradin within Afganistan. Soon, our economy will recover."
afg.19.a:0 "Welcome, gentlemen!"

afg.20.t:0 "Fate of "Machine-Khana" "
afg.20.d:0 "We managed to defeat the Afghans and made them our servants. The whole region has nothing but one manufacture called "Machine-Khana". This small factory is all the industrial power the Afghans have. Moreover, the manufacture serves as main mint. Should we destroy it to completely disrupt industrial revolution in Afghanistan?"
afg.20.a:0 "Welcome to the Stone Age!"
afg.20.b:0 "I see a potential. Let's invest some money in them instead."
afg.20.c:0 "We are not barbarians. Leave it be."

afg.21.t:0 "The "Machine-Khana" is destroyed"
afg.21.d:0 "Indian bastards decided to destroy our only manufacture. With "Machine-Khana" no more it will be very hard to produce weapons and mint money."
afg.21.a:0 "How dare them!"

afg.22.t:0 "Indians decided to invest money into us"
afg.22.d:0 "Some Indian capitalist have started a campaign to build up our industry. No doubt, they want to make us a colonial servants working on Indian factories for minimal salary without any rights. Anyway, it's better to have some industry. Someday, the Afghani people will rise to gain independence and they will use these factories against Indians."
afg.22.a:0 "Better than nothing."

afg.23.t:0 "Muslim traditionalists criticise Ammanulah"
afg.23.d:0 "Our population keep their tradition. Our recent reforms caused a serious displeasemnet among rural muslims and Tajik tribesman. A setback in 5th Anglo-Afghan made them think that we are weak and not worth to lead the country. We heard a charismatic Tajik man named Habibullah gathering an angrt mob against us. However, his ranks are few now."
afg.23.a:0 "They don't understand the benefits of industrialisation!"

afg.24.t:0 "Rise of radical Islamism"
afg.24.d:0 "Further reforms were met only with disapproval. Recently, our people have learned that Ammanulah's wife don't wear her paranja and the emir himself treat foreign infidels as his friends. Radical Islamists leading by Habibullah Kalakani set a rebellion against us. They raiding the villages and strike our soldiers from ambushes. Should we send Nadir Shash's men to pacify the radicals? He will help us, but his authority will also rise making him a political opponent to Ammanulah."
afg.24.a:0 "Crush the barbarians!"
afg.24.b:0 "We will not kill our own people"

afg.25.t:0 "A civil war in Afghanistan"
afg.25.d:0 "Things are getting worse day by day. Habibullah has managed to gather a huge army of angry peasants and Islamic fanatics. They entered Kabul and marching towards emir's palace wanting Amanullah's head. Our army barely can stop them!"
afg.25.a:0 "Radicals raze the emir's palace and declare Shariah law"
afg.25.b:0 "Nadir Shah seize the throne in order to bring stability"
