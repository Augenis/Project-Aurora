In the November of 1919 a revolutionary General Strike was called by the CGT, paralysing the country and causing the downfall of the bourgeois government. ‘The Party of Order’ was not strong enough to put an end to the unrest and in the following months the ‘Establishment’ were forced out of France by a coalition of leftist forces in a brief but brutal civil war. \n For the past 15 years the self styled ‘Commune of France’ has united behind a common platform of Syndicalist-Socialist consensus, headed by the ruling Comit? de Salut Public. However, by 1936 the consensus that was resolved to rebuild the shattered country and defend the fruits of revolution from foreign menace is deemed as outdated by many critics, and there is a growing call for more radical policies.

 comfrance.130.b:0 "We shall reform Syndicalism from within."
 comfrance.131.t:0 "Restructuring of the BGT and CSP"
 comfrance.131.d:0 "The Syndicalist structures of post-revolution France are being transformed so as to better comply with true Marxism as laid out by the Parti Communiste Français. The Bourse Générale du Travail has been reformed as the Congrès des Députés du Peuple while the Comité de Salut Public has been replaced by the Conseil des Commissaires du Peuple."
 comfrance.131.a:0 "An improvement, no doubt"
 comfrance.132.t:0 "Dissolution of the CGT"
 comfrance.132.d:0 "Now we turn on the last pillar of Syndicalism in France, the Confederation General du Travail - the dominant Syndicate which long kept us from taking power in the Commune. We can finally break their power, so as to prevent our rival from further resisting our Communist doctrine."
 comfrance.132.a:0 "They are against our Revolution"
 comfrance.133.t:0 "Reports of unrest within the military"
 comfrance.133.d:0 "Our recent reforms, while making grand strides in setting France on the true path of Socialism, has upset many in French society. Now there are reports reaching the ears of the Comité de Renseignements Généraux that there are murmers of dissent even within the Guarantor of National Integrity..."
 comfrance.133.a:0 "Keep a close eye..."
 comfrance.134.t:0 "Léon Blum and the Front Populaire"
 comfrance.134.d:0 "Now the leading Travailleur figure, Léon Blum has begun to call openly for the disparate political factions of France to unite in opposition to the Jacobin government which many view as having corrupted and betrayed the Revolution. This Popular Front, despite being resisted by the many state mechanisms of the Jacobins, has already conducted several major industrial actions and political rallies in the larger cities. Fearful that this open challange to the party's rule might lead to a direct contest for the leadership of the Commune, the Renseignements Généraux is recommending that the Conseil des Commissaires arrest Blum and the other leaders linked to the Front - most prominetly other than Blum himself, the still respected general Maurice Gamelin."
 comfrance.134.a:0 "Bring them to trial!"
 comfrance.134.b:0 "Leninist valours will endure these traitors"
 comfrance.135.t:0 "The Paris Trial"
 comfrance.135.d:0 "The various leading figures of the Front Populaire, as well as other prominent potential allies of theirs, such as Maurice Gamelin have been arrested and are being tried for treason. The Paris Trial aimed to prove that Blum and his associates had undermined the Revolution and 'weakened France's defences against the German foe'. Blum, being both a lawyer and excellent public speaker, used the courtroom to make a brilliant indictment of the Jacobin regime. Gamelin remained silent throughout; refusing to recognise the courts right to try him. The trial has not gone according to plan and the defendants have, despite heavy manipulation of the proceedings, proven largely successful in rebutting the charges, and won sympathetic coverage in both the unoficial domestic and international press. It has become such an embarrassment to our Communist regime that some of the leadership is considering ordering it called off. Others wish to push forward and execute the defendents regardless, as they have become far too great a threat to be allowed to go free."
 comfrance.135.a:0 "Execute these traitors!"
 comfrance.135.b:0 "Call the whole thing off"
 comfrance.136.t:0 "Anti-Jacobin Riots"

 comfrance.137.d:0 "Reports are reaching the Renseignements Généraux that units loyal to the civil war general Maurice Gamelin have mutinied and declared for the Popular Front. Gamelin is marching on Paris!"
 comfrance.137.a:0 "We shall resist these rebels!"
 comfrance.137.b:0 "The rebels seize the capital!"
 comfrance.138.t:0 "The Front Populaire Restores Syndicalism"
 comfrance.138.d:0 "The Front Populaire has seized Paris and is purging the Jacobins from the city. Communes throughout France have taken this opportunity to liquidate their own branches of the Communist Party. Gamelin and Blum have restored the formerly abolished Syndicalist institutions the CGT and BGT and in emergency elections, Gamelin hase been elected as Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail and Blum appointed as Chairman of the Comité de Salut Public."
 comfrance.138.a:0 "C'est la lutte finale..."
 comfrance.139.t:0 "Gamelin's Coup Fails"
 comfrance.139.d:0 "We successfully resisted the forces of the traitor Gamelin who has now turned tail and fled south with the Arm of the Communist Revolution in hot pursuit! However, the partisans of the Front Populaire have gone ahead with their revolt in the north despite this set back, although they are sure to be crushed by our loyal units."
 comfrance.139.a:0 "Crush them!"

 comfrance.140.d:0 "The last remains of Gamelin's rebels have occupied the city of Toulouse. Now that we have them cornered we shall despatch our loyal forces to destroy them!"
 comfrance.140.a:0 "Death to the traitors!"
 comfrance.141.t:0 "France in Chaos"
 comfrance.141.d:0 "The extremist Jacobin faction has driven the illigitimate Commune to the precipice. The socialists fight amongst themselves as France burns. The traitor general Maurice Gamelin failed to overthrow the Communist at the first attempt and was forced to retreat south. We have received word via secret channels that Gamelin is willing to recognise our Republic in return for aid in defeating the Jacobins. Although considered one of the worst traitors France has ever seen for leading the reds in the first civil war which saw us reduced to our exile in Algiers, this could be our best chance to return home and drive out the craven Communards that stole it from us."
 comfrance.141.a:0 "This is our moment! To France!"
 comfrance.141.b:0 "He is a traitor. He will die a traitor."
 comfrance.142.t:0 "Gamelin Joins The Nationalists!"
 comfrance.142.d:0 "The arch-traitor Gamelin has declared for the Fourth Republic! His soldiers are advancing on Marseille, surely to prepare the way for the Nationalist forces that are even now readying to invade our homeland. Although this shows that he has abandoned his erstwhile allies in the Front Populaire, the syndicalists have taken this opportunity to redouble their efforts, launching uprisings across France."
 comfrance.142.a:0 "Crush them!"
 comfrance.143.t:0 "A War of Opportunity?"
 comfrance.143.d:0 "The continuing chaos in France is reassuring, yet certain members of the General Staff are pushing the Kaiser to use this window of opportunity to launch an attack westward against the Commune - a house divided cannot stand, surely. We may not get a better chance than this, but our economy is still crippled by the events of Black Monday."
 comfrance.143.a:0 "Attack!"
