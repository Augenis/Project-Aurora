dkb.1.t:0 "Don-Kuban Union"
dkb.1.d:0 "Don-Kuban Union was proclaimed by Pyotr Krasnov on the 18th of May 1918, when he was elected as the 'Ataman' ('Leader') of the Don Cossacks. Since then Krasnov, who used to be a connecting link between the leadership of the White Army and the Germans, started to strengthen his regime in South Russia, by improving his relations with the separatist leaders of the Kuban and Terek Cossacks. With the German help Don-Kuban Union could finally break away from Russia, which Krasnov as the Ataman of the Union condemned for its new republican system, using the conservative and pro-monarchist feelings of the South Russian population. But the new established Union still have to face with lots of problems. The lack of the modern industry weakens the Army of the Union, the people want the land redistribution and reunification with Russia, the separatist tensions in the various parts of the Caucasus grow. If Pyotr Krasnov wants to stay as the Ataman of the Don-Kuban Union, he will have to deal with all these problems in his country."
