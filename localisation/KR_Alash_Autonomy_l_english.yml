### Event text ###
 alash.1.t:0 "Independence for Alash autonomy ?"
 alash.1.d:0 "Our country, despite nominally part of Russia with autonomous status has been de facto independent from the singing of the Minsk treaty in 1920. Despite Russian attempt in 1925 to fully integrate us into Russia during repellling invasion from Turkestan, our status remained unchanged thanks to the attempt of admiral Koltschak to seize power in Russia. Now with Russia engulfed in chaos, the time has come to throw off chains of Russian opression and end farce of Alash-Orda being part of Russia !"
 alash.1.a:0 "No, we must remain loyal to Russia"
 alash.1.b:0 "Declare full independence from Russia"

 alash.2.t:0 "Alash autonomous region declares independence !"
 alash.2.d:0 "Terrible news ! Our autonomous region of Alash-Orda has decided to use political chaos in Russia following assassination of Kerensky to sever almost all ties with Russia and declare independence. While many hotheads in general staff are demanding immediate action, ongoing chaos prevents us from responding to this tretchery. It seems that we must let Alash-Orda be. For now..."
 alash.2.a:0 "There is nothing we can do..."

 alash.3.t:0 "The Peoples of Alash Orda"
 alash.3.d:0 "Our population is divided into three separate communities, and if it is to remain stable, it is necessary for our government to favour one of these groups above the others.  Make this decision carefully, as it may lead to international complications."
 alash.3.a:0 "The Kazakhs and Turkmen: they make up the majority of our population"
 alash.3.b:0 "The ethnic Russians: they control the economy"
 alash.3.c:0 "Our security depends upon the Cossacks"
