### Events ###
serbia.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of Serbia"
serbia.1.d:0 "The assassination of the Archduke Ferdinand by a Serb nationalist in 1914 proved to be the catalyst that began the Weltkrieg. Despite expecting an easy campaign, Austrian forces only managed to occupy Serbia itself in late 1915, and because of the entrance of Bulgaria in the war. After the war Serbia's southern territories were handed over to Bulgaria, whilst the remainder was kept under Austrian occupation until 1926, when the Austrians were forced to withdraw their troops due to ethnic tensions elsewhere in the Empire.\n\nSince then Serbia has struggled to survive, keeping a low profile in light of the knowledge that she could not stand up to any sort of military attack. Over time however the government has become increasingly anti-Austrian and jingoistic, and knowing that they could not hope to defeat Austria they have instead turned their attentions southwards, towards the lands occupied by Bulgaria. Several diplomatic talks have already been conducted with the Romanian and Greek governments with a view to undermining Bulgarian hegemony in the region, and some say talk of a formal alliance is not far off.\n\nCan Serbia successfully steer a course to triumph in the 'Bulgarian Matter'? And if so, can she finally defeat the old enemy Austria, and realise her dream of a pan-Slavic Union?"
serbia.1.a:0 "Serbia will be great again!"

serbia.2.t:0 "Vidovdan"
serbia.2.d:0 "Vidovdan represents the day to commemorate Saint Prince Lazar and the Serbian holy martyrs who gave their lives to defend the true faith during the epic Battle of Kosovo against the Ottoman Empire on June 28, 1389. It is regarded as a National Holiday in Serbia."
serbia.2.a:0 "Serbia will never forget its heroes!"

serbia.4.t:0 "The opening of the new parliament building"
serbia.4.d:0 "Construction on a new parliament building started in 1907, with the cornerstone being laid by King Peter I. The Weltkrieg delayed the construction, and the original plans to the building were lost, but a reconstruction of the plans was made by Pavle Ilkic. The interior was designed by Nikolaj Krasnov in the manner of academic traditionalism. The construction of the building was recently completed and the first session in the new edifice is about to be held."
serbia.4.a:0 "It's beautiful."
