### Events ###
ven.1.t:0 "Venezuela's place in the world"
ven.1.d:0 "After 1830 a number of civil wars between conservatives and liberals rocked the country. In 1864 this period came to an end with the federalisation of the country and the proclamation of the Estados Unidos de Venezuela (United States of Venezuela). Only the dictatorship of General Antonio Guzm n Blancos (1870 - 1887) consolidated the situation. After a few civilian presidents new military dictatorships follow. General Cipriano Castro (1899 - 1908) undertook assaults on foreign economic interests in his country eventually leading to the blocking of Venezuelan ports by German British and Italian ships. In 1904 the U.S.A. mediated a settlement of the conflict. Economically the the abolition of slavery in 1854 led to decreasing agricultural production. The breakthrough to make Venezuela one of Latin America's leading economic powers was made however when at the end of 19th century petroleum deposits were discovered allowing the industrialisation of the agricultural state. Under General Juan Vicente G¢mez (1908 - 1929 1931 - 1935) oil production became the economic foundation of Venezuela (aided by foreign capital). The country having remained neutral during the Weltkrieg was able to reduce the state's debts and to stabilise the currency."
ven.1.a:0 "We do live in interesting times"
ven.2.t:0 "Dissent"
ven.2.d:0 "Neighbouring Brazil and Bolivia have both been taken over by Syndicalist governments, which has caused the air here in Venezuela to be tense. Along side the mountains are giant barrios where life is a struggle for everyday people."
ven.2.a:0 "A Wind of Change will blow down from the mountain side barrios"
ven.3.t:0 "Dissent turns into Revolt"
ven.3.d:0 "A Mass Protest turned into an Angry Mob as the people came down from the barrios on the mountain side to protest and demand a new constitution that was voted against yesterday. Encouraged by the governments of Bolivia and Brazil, they have repeated the pattern and surrounded the Presidential Palace."
ven.3.a:0 "Give into their Demands!"
ven.3.b:0 "Crush this Rebellion!"
ven.4.t:0 "The New Government of Venezuela"
ven.4.d:0 "Juna Bautista Fuenmayor forms his cabinet."
ven.4.a:0 "A government by the people for the people!"
ven.5.t:0 "The 1941 Presidential election"
ven.5.d:0 "While currently the President is elected by the Legislature, it's not any easier than a national election and therefore anyone can win. However, there is only two candidates in this election, either Isaías Medina Angarita or the current President with the former likely going to win..."
ven.5.a:0 "Isaías Medina Angarita is our man!"
ven.5.b:0 "The current President is fine"
ven.6.t:0 "A day in Autumn"
ven.6.d:0 "With Medina Angarita having been our President for some time now, his policies have increasingly pleased no one. Because of this, critics of him have begun plotting a coup detat headed by Rómulo Betancourt..."
ven.6.a:0 "Rómulo Betancourt takes over!"
ven.6.b:0 "Medina Angarita continues to lead the nation"
ven.7.t:0 "The 1947 Presidential election"
ven.7.d:0 "This election will go down in Venezuelan history because this is the first election the people directly elect the President! Because the Social Democrats forced this and other social reforms, they are viewed quite with high regard by the people and are likely to be the Christian Democrats..."
ven.7.a:0 "The Social Democrats win it!"
ven.7.b:0 "The Christian Democrats win it!"
ven.8.t:0 "The Venezuelan Oil Industry"
ven.8.d:0 "Oil has always been a chief export of Venezuela, as far back as we can remember. It has been proposed that we take the Oil Industry from the hands of foreign companies and sell the oil to them ourselves. Our profits would increase and we would have taken another step towards true independence and self dependence."
ven.8.a:0 "The Oil Refined Here is Ours, Nationalise!"
ven.8.b:0 "We would not want to upset foreign interests"
ven.9.t:0 "Alliance with Brazil?"
ven.9.d:0 "The world is a dangerous place, so we need alliances with sworn enemies of the capitalism. Venezuela and Brazil could benefit from joining forces in a crusade for a new, brave world. Anti-socialist warmongers from La Plata are seeking war to crush the successful Brazilian and Venezuelan revolutions, so we need to combine our powers to defend the spoils of our proletarian uprisings!"
ven.9.a:0 "Propose an Alliance with Brazil"
ven.9.b:0 "Rather not"
ven.10.t:0 "Alliance with Venezuela?"
ven.10.d:0 "Venezuela has proposed an axis be formed, a defensive alliance between Brazil and Venezuela against capitalist menace. What should we tell them?"
ven.10.a:0 "Accept their offer!"
ven.10.b:0 "Refuse their alliance, we don't need anyone!"
ven.80.t:0 "Alliance with Venezuela?"
ven.80.d:0 "Venezuela has proposed an axis be formed, a defensive alliance between La Plata and Venezuela against the Syndicalist menace. What should we tell them?"
ven.80.a:0 "Accept their offer!"
ven.80.b:0 "Refuse their alliance, we don't need anyone!"
ven.11.t:0 "Black Monday hits the Oil Wells!"
ven.11.d:0 "Venezuela's economy has been in a golden age since the discovery of our rich oil wells. The hungry war machines of Europe and industries of America and Japan have long bought all the oil they could afford. However, after the crash, things went sideways alarmingly, if unsurprisingly, quickly. Oil prices plummeted, and state revenue too. Soon basic services will suffer, and the Regime will have a tough couple of years ahead of itself"
ven.11.a:0 "Catastrophic!"
