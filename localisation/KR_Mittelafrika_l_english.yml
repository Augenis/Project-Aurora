### Events ###
mittel.1.t:0 "The Mittelafrikan Military"
mittel.1.d:0 "There is a problem in our Military, currently both the airforce and the NCOs are made up of German Colonists, however due to Stadhalter Göring's recent expansion of both of these sections of our military, there is a shortage of Germans to recruit into them. Due to this problem, we will have to fill the ranks of either the air force or NCOs with Natives. Which one will it be?"
mittel.1.a:0 "The airforce is our pride and joy! Fill the NCOs"
mittel.1.b:0 "The NCOs are the most important! Fill the airforce"
mittel.2.t:0 "Decolonisation of the Offices"
mittel.2.d:0 "Many in Mittelafrika wish to see us grant natives more power within our government, as a continuation of our policy of giving natives priority in governorship"
mittel.2.a:0 "Power to the natives!"
mittel.2.b:0 "The natives have enough power, we are a German colony after all."
mittel.3.t:0 "Annual Financial Statement of Mittelafrika for the Year of 1937"
mittel.3.d:0 "The Reichstag has begun to examine the financial statements of Germany's colonies for the year 1937. Particular attention was focused on Mittelafrika's financial statements, as this part of the colonial empire frequently requests an increase in budget, which was granted in the past. However, there are unverified reports that a large part of the budget is misused by Staathalter Goering for his personal profit. Members of the SPD and FVP parties are requesting more thorough examinations of Mittelafrikan financial statements to either refute or confirm these reports."
mittel.3.a:0 "The audit finds evidence of corruption in the highest levels!"
mittel.3.b:0 "The audit finds nothing"
mittel.4.t:0 "Goering's Fate"
mittel.4.d:0 "The Reichstag's audit of Mittelafrika has expanded into a general investigation of Mittelafrikan affairs, and what we have found through is alarming. Money laundering, political murders, corruption, embezzlement and more. The source of the corruption was traced to Goering and his self appointed cabinet."
mittel.4.a:0 "Remove him from his office !"
mittel.4.b:0 "Germany values its heroes ! "
mittel.5.t:0 "New statthalter for Mittelafrika"
mittel.5.d:0 "As we got rid of Hermann Goering, after a comission of the Imperial Government found out about his embezzlement schemes, the German Colonial Ministry must now select a new Statthalter (Governor-General) for Mittelafrika. But who will be his replacement? Both Ernst Junger, the conservative Prussian writer and Chief of Staff of the Mittelafrikan Army, and Theodor von Hippel, head of the Mittelafrikan branch of the Abwehr, are the main candidates amongst the Colonial administration. But a reformist faction, seeking to improve relations with the local African elites, is pushing either for Karl Atangana, the loyal paramount chief of the Ewondo people of Niger-Kamerun or for Achirimbi II, the tenth king of Bafut in Kamerun."
mittel.5.a:0 "Ernst Junger, the famous writer!"
mittel.5.b:0 "Theodor von Hippel, the war hero!"
