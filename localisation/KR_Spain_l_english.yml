### Events ###

### Domestic ###

sprd.1.t: "The Kingdom of Spain"
sprd.1.d:0 "The Kingdom of Spain: Once the greatest of the Colonial Empires, she saw all of her remaining overseas colonies lost after a swift war against the USA in 1898. After this, separatist movements in both the Basque country and Catalonia arose, and both the Church and a radical worker's movement, the CNT, are interfering in her internal politics. Spain's populace has become deeply divided. \n\nAfter taking his place on the throne in 1902, King Alfonso XIII seemed keen on regaining Spain's former status as a colonial power by intervening in Morocco. The intervention lasted for a whole decade, and the outcome, while a victory, was not exactly in favour for Spain: Her Moroccan possessions remain a source of permanent unrest. Spain turned in on herself afterwards, remaining neutral during the Weltkrieg, all while the populace's faith in King Alfonso faded. \n\nAs a result of the General Elections of 1931, the Second Spanish Republic was proclaimed, and Alfonso, accepting the will of his people, went into exile. However, the Republic lasted only a short while. The Kingdom was restored by a coup d'état lead by General Sanjurjo just a year later. Still, the memories of the short-lived failure that was the Spanish Republic fuel the regime's opponents left and right. \n\nTo date, there remain deep divisions within Spanish society. On the one hand, the resurgent Carlist Movement, headed by Alfonso Carlos, aims to re-establish the 'True Dynasty' and recreate an integralist Christian monarchy, and on the other, the anarcho-syndicalist CNT-FAI seeks the abolition of the Spanish state altogether, and to replace it with a voluntary federation of communes and economic collectives. If the political split is not mended, Spain might even see a Civil War."
sprd.1.a: "Let us prevail."

sprd.2.t:0 "Black Monday hits Spain"
sprd.2.d:0 "The Spanish economy has been tied to Germany since the end of the Weltkrieg. Since France and England's defeat, a good portion of our economy has been centred around exporting materials and goods to the German markets. As such, we can expect a flood of layoffs and closings. Our political foes will undoubtedly use this to their advantage."
sprd.2.a:0 "We did not need this!"

sprd.3.t:0 "Breakdown of our Society"
sprd.3.d:0 "The bickering of both leftist and traditionalist fanatics have been driving the Spanish people into a frenzy, and the sustained economic crisis following Black Monday has poured gasoline onto the embers. Several political groups have called for open protest against our reign."
sprd.3.a:0 "This is not going to end well."

### Carlist Chain ###

sprd.4.t:0 "Alfonso Carlos de Borbón dies"
sprd.4.d:0 "Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime, and the Carlist claimant to the throne of Spain, died today in Vienna at the age of 86. He died a natural death, so his passing should have put an end to the problem of Carlist succession, as the current King, Alfonso XIII, is now the head of the Capetian dynasty. Alas, the head of the Carlist community in Spain, Duke Javier de Borbón-Parma, was designated instead by the Duke as his rightful heir."
sprd.4.a:0 "The Carlists must be plotting something."

sprd.5.t:0 "Javier's Speech"
sprd.5.d:0 "Javier de Borbón, the leader of the Carlist movement and pretender to the Spanish throne. Yesterday, he gave a speech arguing that the Kingdom of Spain needs to work closer together with our neighbours during this time of economic crisis. He proposes to form an economic block with other Mediterranean nations to support each other through these hard times."
sprd.5.a:0 "While his efforts are admirable, he is still a threat. Keep him under surveillance."

sprd.6.t:0 "Portugal agrees to join Javier's Bloc"
sprd.6.d:0 "Portugal has agreed to Javier's proposed Mediterranean Economic Bloc. While this will help the recovery of our economy, it helps the areas that Javier holds sway over the most."
sprd.6.a:0 "Any help is better than no help"

sprd.7.t:0 "Italian Federation agrees to join Javier's Bloc"
sprd.7.d:0 "The Italian Federation has agreed to Javier's proposed Mediterranean Economic Bloc. While this will help the recovery of our economy, it helps the areas that Javier holds sway over the most."
sprd.7.a:0 "Any help is better than no help"

sprd.8.t:0 "Javier's Ambitions to the Throne"
sprd.8.d:0 "Following his recent diplomatic successes abroad, Carlist leader Javier has given another speech. He uses his successes to claim himself more suited to run this country than King Alfonso."
sprd.8.a:0 "Time to ban his organisation"
sprd.8.b:0 "Arrest Javier and his followers!"
sprd.8.c:0 "Praise his efforts"
sprd.8.e:0 "Ignore the pretender"

sprd.9.t:0 "Bombing!"
sprd.9.d:0 "Last night, one of our commanders was killed in a bombing incident."
sprd.9.a:0 "Curses!"

sprd.10.t:0 "Carlist Protests"
sprd.10.d:0 "Supporters of the Carlist movement have taken to the streets to protest our government, calling our recent policies 'godless'."
sprd.10.a:0 "Disperse them"

sprd.11.t:0 "Assassination!"
sprd.11.d:0 "Yesterday, late at night, after a long day debating the status of our country's internal security, our current administration's Chief of Security, Miguel Ponte Mansó de Zúñiga, was gunned down on his way home from work."
sprd.11.a:0 "May he rest in peace"

sprd.12.t:0 "Assassination!"
sprd.12.d:0 "Last night, José Ungría Jiménez, the Minister of Intelligence, was killed by a car bomb on his way home from work!"
sprd.12.a:0 "Oh my"

### CNT-FAI Chain ###

sprd.13.t:0 "The CNT-FAI"
sprd.13.d:0 "The anarcho-syndicalist union of the CNT-FAI are one of the greatest threats to His Majesty's Government. Yesterday, Joaquin Maur匤 Juli・, a leader in the movement made a speech entitled 'My Heroes' in which he stated that the CNT will attempt to organise all laid off workers in an effort to save the country's economy."
sprd.13.a:0 "Ban the organisation of workers"
sprd.13.b:0 "Arrest the leaders of the movement"
sprd.13.c:0 "Forcefully disband the movement"
sprd.13.e:0 "Allow this to happen"

sprd.14.t:0 "The CNT-FAI protests"
sprd.14.d:0 "CNT-FAI supporters have taken to the streets to protest our government's policies"
sprd.14.a:0 "Disperse them"

sprd.15.t:0 "CNT-FAI launch nationwide protests"
sprd.15.d:0 "In response to our banning of their effort to organise the unemployed the CNT have launched a national protest campaign."
sprd.15.a:0 "Send out the police!"
sprd.15.b:0 "Allow them to organise"

sprd.16.t:0 "Arresting the Leaders of the CNT-FAI"
sprd.16.d:0 "Our police moved to arrest the leaders of the CNT-FAI, but we have found none. There must be a rat in our police! The leaders are probably underground or out of the country"
sprd.16.a:0 "Find the rat and establish a secret police!"
sprd.16.b:0 "We knew this would happen"

sprd.17.t:0 "Disbanding the CNT-FAI"
sprd.17.d:0 "Our police and military have moved to disband and arrest as many CNT-FAI members as possible. However, we have found almost none. They appear to have fled or gone into hiding"
sprd.17.a:0 "This shows how weak they are!"

sprd.18.t:0 "Organising the workers"
sprd.18.d:0 "The CNT-FAI have set about organising the laid-off workers and the unemployed. They have come up with series of projects to put these people to work on."
sprd.18.a:0 "Watch them carefully"

sprd.19.t:0 "CNT-FAI start operations!"
sprd.19.d:0 "The CNT-FAI have announced that they are opening a series of public projects and mining operations along the southern coast. Organised in a communal system, these operations are loosely controlled from their headquarters in a small town called Agua Amarga."
sprd.19.a:0 "Let them work"

sprd.20.t:0 "The mines and roads are opening"
sprd.20.d:0 "The CNT-FAI's operations in the southern part of our country are steadily reaching their planned production. The organisation has put the workers to good use. Everything seems to be going very well"
sprd.20.a:0 "Well shall see where this goes"

### Elections ###

sprd.21.t:0 "Our King has a stroke!"
sprd.21.d:0 "In the early morning, King Alfonso III suffered a serious stroke. His doctors are caring for him but the outcome is unknown!"
sprd.21.a:0 "Ohh no!"

sprd.22.t:0 "Alfonso is in a Coma"
sprd.22.d:0 "While the current condition of His Majesty is stable, he has not yet regained consciousness - the King is in a coma. Our country's best It is unknown whether or not he will every recover from this travesty. Our political enemies are demanding action be taken to change the government of Spain forever!"
sprd.22.a:0 "Call for free and open elections"
sprd.22.b:0 "Call for elections, but with only selected parties"
sprd.22.c:0 "The King is not dead! Do nothing!"

sprd.23.t:0 "General Elections"
sprd.23.d:0 "The elections have been held and all parties have agreed and acted in good faith."
sprd.23.a:0 "The ruling party wins!"
sprd.23.b:0 "A CNT-FAI Victory!"
sprd.23.c:0 "The Carlists win!"

sprd.24.t:0 "Elections - cancelled"
sprd.24.d:0 "Due to the civil war the elections have been officially cancelled"

sprd.25.d:0 "When we called for elections that disallowed the CNT and Carlists we knew there would be issues... Now the day before elections there are riots in several parts of the country"

sprd.25.b:0 "Nothing will stop this election"

sprd.26.t:0 "The Election Day Disaster!"
sprd.26.d:0 "This Election day has been marred by countless acts of violence, 4 polling places have been bombed, over a thousand people have been killed in other violence. Entire groups of Police and Military troops have disappeared"
sprd.26.a:0 "This was a mistake!"

sprd.27.t:0 "What to do with the King?"
sprd.27.d:0 "The war is over and the King is still in a coma. Should we officially announce that Juan III is the new king, or should he remain in the background?"
sprd.27.a:0 "Name him as Alfonso's successor"
sprd.27.b:0 "No, perhaps the time of the kingdom is over"

sprd.28.t:0 "Restoring the Monarchy"
sprd.28.d:0 "After the assassination of Juan, a void was left in the terms of a Royal Regent. Now Juan's older brother Jaime has returned from abroad and is requesting his rightful place as the heir to our Kingdom."

sprd.29.t:0 "Spanish Elections"
sprd.29.d.spr:0 "Today marked a startling result in the Spanish elections, held amid much violence and protest by the syndicalists and Carlist anarchists. Despite the efforts of those fringe groups, the ruling Acción Popular proved victorious- and, while opposition parties initially contested the election results, so far it appears as if the win is legitimate. While this by no means restores calm in [SPR.GetNameDef], it goes a long way to reassuring the public that the government maintains popular support and that a civil war has been narrowly averted."
sprd.29.d.cnt:0 "Today marked a startling result in the Spanish elections, held amid much violence and protest. The anarcho-syndicalist party known as the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo - Federación Anarquista Ibérica - or the CNT-FAI - proved victorious by a wide margin. While the opposing Carlists initially contested the results, so far it appears as if the leftist win is legitimate and the CNT-FAI's central committee has already taken power in Madrid. The new government will have many challenges ahead in restoring order, but it seems as if a Spanish civil war has been narrowly averted."
sprd.29.d.car:0 "Today marked a startling result in the Spanish elections, held amid much violence and protest. The Falange Española, supporters of the Carlist dynasty, proved victorious by a wide margin, paving the way for Infante Javier de Borbón-Parma to take the place of the comatose Alfonso XIII as the ruling King of Spain. While leftist parties initially contested the results, so far it appears as if the Carlist win is legitimate and Javier's coronation is scheduled to take place within the week. The new government will have many challenges ahead in restoring order, but it seems as if a Spanish civil war has been narrowly averted."
sprd.29.a:0 "Peace rules in Spain!"
sprd.29.b:0 "I see..."

sprc.101.d:0 "The legitimate Spanish Kingdom under Alfonso XIII is under severe threat from anarchists and fanatics! While many are saying that this provides further proof of the terminal weakness of the House of Bourbon, a secure Spain is an important part of our defensive plans. It could be wise to help the Government put an end to these threats."

sprc.122.t:0 "[Root.GetAdjective] Terror"

sprc.123.d:0 "The Spanish Civil War is finally over, and it seems that [SPR.GetNameDef] has emerged triumphant. Much of the countryside lies in ruins, and order has not completely been restored, but the [SPR.GetAdjective] government announced that the anarchist and syndicalist threats had finally been dealt with and would be unlikely to rise again anytime soon. This is a triumph for King Alfonso XIII, though the king is unlikely to know of it, having fallen into a coma shortly before the civil war broke out."

sprc.228.d:0 "At the invitation of [CNT.GetNameDef], forces from [FRA.GetNameDef] have moved in to occupy Gibraltar - no doubt to protect it from an arriving German force fearing syndicalist control over access to the Mediterranean Sea."
sprc.228.a:0 "Excellent"
sprc.228.b:0 "They GAVE away Gibraltar?!"

sprc.229.t:0 "[FRA.GetNameDef] Refuses"
sprc.229.d:0 "Perhaps they fear German might, or perhaps they simply do not value Gibraltar enough. Either way, the [FRA.GetAdjective] government has refused to step into the situation."
sprc.229.a:0 "Then we protect Gibraltar on our own"

sprc.230.t:0 "[FRA.GetAdjective] Navy Moves In"
sprc.230.d:0 "While unwilling to help us protect Gibraltar directly, [FRA.GetNameDef] has moved in several powerful ships - ideally to deter the Germans from attacking. We will see if this tactic works."
sprc.230.a:0 "Fingers crossed!"

sprc.231.t:0 "The Pieces are in Place"
sprc.231.d:0 "Gibraltar is guarded by some CNT-FAI militia. They seem to be veterans of a few battles and the isthmus itself is a fortress. Should we give the green light?"
sprc.231.a:0 "Launch the operation"
sprc.231.b:0 "Back down - we don't want a war"

sprc.232.t:0 "Germany Backs Down"
sprc.232.d:0 "The German forces neared Gibraltar...and then simply departed after a couple of days, never beginning their assault. It seems they have backed down."
sprc.232.a:0 "Hurrah! Crisis averted!"

sprc.233.t:0 "We Have the Rock"
sprc.233.d:0 "After a quick but pitched battle, our forces have overtaken the defenders and now have hold of Gibraltar."
sprc.233.a:0 "Our sealanes are safe!"

sprc.234.t:0 "Our Forces Have Been Defeated"
sprc.234.d:0 "This morning our forces attacked the Rock of Gibraltar and got cast back into the sea despite their valiant efforts."
sprc.234.a:0 "This is not good"

sprc.235.t:0 "The Pieces are in Place"
sprc.235.d:0 "Gibraltar is guarded by some CNT-FAI militia. They seem to be veterans of a few battles and the island is a fortress. The French navy has also stationed several ships right around the island. If we go ahead we may risk a wider conflict. Should we give the green light?"
sprc.236.d:0 "Gibraltar has been occupied by French forces, invited by the CNT-FAI. They seem to be an elite marine unit with naval support and the island is a fortress. Should we give the green light?"
sprc.236.a:0 "Who cares - attack!"
sprc.236.b:0 "Back down - we are not ready for a full-scale war"

sprc.237.t:0 "The Rock Remains Standing"
sprc.237.d:0 "This morning [GER.GetAdjective] forces attacked the Rock of Gibraltar and got cast back into the sea despite their efforts. It remains in our hands."
sprc.237.a:0 "Germany has been made a fool today!"

sprc.238.t:0 "The Rock has been Lost"
sprc.238.d:0 "After a quick but pitched battle, [GER.GetAdjective] forces managed to pull off a heroic feat and took the Rock of Gibraltar. They now have a definitive hold over it."
sprc.238.a:0 "Alas!"
sprc.238.b:0 "They have gone too far - to war!"
sprc.238.c:0 "We will not push this further"

### Carlists ###

sprc.301.t:0 "Carlist Uprising"
sprc.301.d:0 "Spain is collapsing into anarchy, and the Pope has declared that all good Catholics should support the Carlist cause - We should send aid at once!"
sprc.301.a:0 "Publicly Support the Carlists"
sprc.301.b:0 "Remain silent on Spanish affairs"

sprc.302.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] supports us"
sprc.302.d:0 "[From.GetNameDef] has decided to support our cause in the civil war. They have sent soldiers and supplies to support us in the struggle!"
sprc.302.a:0 "Good."

sprc.303.t:0 "The End of the Spanish War"
sprc.303.d:0 "For good or ill, the Spanish war is now over. The General Staff have reported that they learnt many valuable lessons regarding the nature of modern warfare over the course of the conflict."
sprc.303.a:0 "Great!"

sprc.304.t:0 "Portuguese Supplies and Arms"
sprc.304.d:0 "With our trade deal with Portugal, we have been able to stockpile some arms and supplies to outfit a well-equipped militia unit."

sprc.306.d:0 "Our agents have discovered a plot to kill the Spanish Crown Prince, Juan III - we think the Carlists are behind it, clearly wanting to pave the path for Xavier to ascend to the Spanish throne. How should we react?"
sprc.306.a:0 "Use it as leverage with the Kingdom"
sprc.306.b:0 "Let them do it"

sprc.307.t:0 "A CNT-FAI Offer"
sprc.307.d:0 "The CNT-FAI has secretly approached us with information they claim could save a very important life - namely that of Juan III, the royal heir. If we surrender to them, they will grant clemency for the government and Royal Family. If we do not, the life of the heir and the future of the kingdom will be in serious jeopardy. That is, of course, if we believe them."
sprc.307.a:0 "Never! - the royal family is safe"
sprc.307.b:0 "For the sake of the royal family, we should agree"

sprc.308.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Refuses"
sprc.308.d:0 "Perhaps they do not believe us, or perhaps they value the lives of the royal family so little...either way, the [From.GetAdjective] government has refused our offer of information on the Carlist plot."
sprc.308.a:0 "So be it!"

sprc.309.t:0 "The Kingdom Surrenders"
sprc.309.d:0 "The Kingdom of Spain agreed to surrender to save the lives of the Royal Family. Now much of Spain is under our control and we shall crush the Carlists."
sprc.309.a:0 "The Carlists are next!"

sprc.310.t:0 "Plot Intercepted by the CNT-FAI"
sprc.310.d:0 "Our plot to assassinate the royal heir was, it seems, intercepted by the CNT-FAI...who used the plot to force the royal family to surrender to them, so they could go into protected hiding. We have, it appears, delivered one enemy right into the hands of another."
sprc.310.a:0 "It was worth the shot"

sprc.311.t:0 "Assassination Plot Fails!"
sprc.311.d:0 "A Carlist plot to assassinate Juan III, the royal heir, only barely failed this morning. A bomb went off when the prince was reviewing troops, but he was only wounded and is expected to pull through."
sprc.311.a:0 "That's a relief!"

sprc.312.d:0 "Our plot to assassinate the royal heir has failed. It seems Crown Prince Juan III was injured by our bomb, but is expected to fully recover from his injuries."
sprc.312.a:0 "Foiled!"

sprc.313.t:0 "The Crown Prince is Dead!"
sprc.313.d:0 "Last night a group of assassins killed the crown prince, Juan III! He had been in the Regency position with his father's coma. But now there is no true heir to the throne! Someone must act quickly to keep the country together!"
sprc.313.a:0 "Miguel Ferrer takes control"
sprc.313.b:0 "Franco Bahamonde becomes the regent"
sprc.313.c:0 "J.M. Gil-Robles Quiñones retains the government"

sprc.315.t:0 "Xavier Crowned King of Spain"
sprc.315.d:0 "With the assassination of the Crown Prince, the Kingdom of Spain has been thrown into further chaos...and their government has decided to join the Carlist cause and crowned Xavier as king of Spain in order to make peace with their Carlist foes."
sprc.315.a:0 "We will defeat them anyhow."

sprc.316.t:0 "Crown Prince Assassinated"
sprc.316.d:0 "The Crown Prince has been successfully assassinated. Though the Kingdom of Spain has been thrown even further into chaos now that there is no heir, they have turned the regency over to [SPR.GetLeader] rather than crown Xavier. Even so, our plot has done what it set out to do."
sprc.316.a:0 "We will see Xavier crowned yet!"

### Post-War ###

sprc.320.t:0 "Victory!"
sprc.320.d:0 "Despite the challenges we faced, we have succeeded in uniting our proud nation! Now that Spain is truly united, we must take our first steps into this new era with our fellow Catholics."

sprc.321.t:0 "The Capital"
sprc.321.d:0 "Now that we have won the Civil War, our Carlist dream has become a reality! But should we move the national capital to the House of Borbón's home in Madrid, or keep it as is?"

sprc.321.b:0 "A new Borbón Dynasty with a new home."

sprc.322.t:0 "The Troubles Continue"
sprc.322.d:0 "Despite our victory in the Civil War, there is still a great amount of unrest and partisan activity around the country. Rebuilding and regaining the trust of the people may take some time."

sprc.323.t:0 "The Nation is Recovering"
sprc.323.d:0 "Our efforts at rebuilding the country and regaining the trust of our people are paying off."

sprc.326.d:0 "The Spanish Civil War is finally over, and it seems that the Carlists have emerged triumphant. Much of the countryside lies in ruins, and order has not completely been restored, but today huge crowds gathered in Burgos to greet their new king, Javier I de Borbón-Parma. The king proclaimed the day a holiday, saying that justice had finally been served to the Spanish pretenders and that the Carlist royal line was exactly where it should be. He promised a national restoration, as well as a return to the nation's Catholic roots. His promise was greeted with approval by the Pope, who offered prayers that Spain's new peace would prove a lasting one."
sprc.326.a:0 "All hail King Javier!"
sprc.326.b:0 "I see..."
