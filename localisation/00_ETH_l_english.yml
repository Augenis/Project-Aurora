ethiopia.1.t:0 "Abyssinia"
ethiopia.1.d:0 "Ethiopia, also known as Abyssinia, was the only African state which managed to remain independent during the XIXth century Scramble for Africa, succesfully defeating an Italian invasion in 1896. This victory kickstarted the proccess of modernization in the Ethiopian Empire, in order to bring the country close to European standards regarding its economy, army and administration. In 1918, under empress Zauditu, the Ethiopian Empire entered the Weltkrieg on the side of the Germans, succesfully annexing the Italian colonies of Somaliland and Eritrea, while also subduing the Dervish State, a rebellious Sunni polity which had existed since 1898. Another sign of Ethiopia's modernization was the expansion of the Addis Abeba-Djibouti railway into the new German colony of Mittelafrika in 1925 - which later became the DPAEB railroad, a vital transport link for the country. In 1930, Empress Zauditu died with no surviving children, which prompted her cousin Ras Tafari Makonnen to ascend the throne as Emperor Haile Selassie. The new monarch announced his intention to start a new series of reforms to bring Ethiopia 'into the west'. These initiatives, however, were fiercely opposed by both the conservative nobility of the nation and the important Italian business community of Eritrea, who feel that any disturbance to the status quo will mean an end to their privileges. The imperial government, meanwhile, has suffered another blow in 1935, when a report by the German Ministry of Trade announced the fragile economical situation of the DPAEB, which puts the entire Ethiopian economy at risk - thus definitely proving the unefficiency of Ethiopia rallying to the German sphere. With an worldwide economical crisis approaching, can the Negus Negast hold on to his throne and guide Abyssinia through these troubled times to prosperity? Or will the throne fall to another rival claimant?"
