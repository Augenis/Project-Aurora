### Events ###
unionstate.1.t:0 "Foundation of the Union State"
unionstate.1.d:0 "NEW ORLEANS. Our beloved leader, Huey Long, today addressed the nation, proclaiming the inauguration of a New Union State over America, which will organise the productive and social resources of the nation, end social conflict, maintain peace and order, and eliminate all enemies of the Republic. This bold new initiative shall be headed by..."
unionstate.1.a:0 "Charles Lindbergh - A popular man of the people"
unionstate.1.b:0 "Gerald L. K. Smith will overhaul the economic and political system"
unionstate.1.c:0 "Father Charles Coughlin will promote a paternal corporate state"
unionstate.1.e:0 "Fritz Kuhn will root out sedition and enemies of the Republic!"
unionstate.2.t:0 "Where Will We Govern From?"
unionstate.2.d:0 "With the end of the Civil War, we should decide where our capital will be. Will it be moved back to Washington?"
unionstate.2.a:0 "Washington is a corrupt city."
unionstate.2.b:0 "Washington has been cleansed of the Corruption."
unionstate.3.t:0 "Rebirth of the Country"
unionstate.3.d:0 "After the devastation of the American Civil War, Long and the America First Party were hoping to rebuild America stronger than before. The Syndicalist threat was still present around the world and a strong America was needed to meet that threat. Due to the war there was a significant labour shortage and tough decisions would be needed to get the country back on its feet."
unionstate.3.a:0 "Conscript the labour required"
unionstate.3.b:0 "The corporations can handle this"
unionstate.571.t:0 "The American Union State Youth"
unionstate.571.d:0 "Fritz Kuhn has submitted a plan to start a Youth Foundation in the AUS and is looking for approval. The Foundation would show Adolescents the purpose of America First and to teach them discipline above all things and loyalty to the New State. We're in need of new recruits, and Fritz Kuhn's Youth Foundation may be part of the solution."
unionstate.571.a:0 "Let Kuhn have his Daycare"
unionstate.571.b:0 "We don't feel comfortable about this..."
unionstate.4.t:0 "The American Union Constitution"
unionstate.4.d:0 "The end of the Civil War and the AUS victory meant a new era for America. A new constitution would be drafted to ensure that the American Union State was on par with that of the founding fathers and that America would be strong and ever vigilante against the enemies of the American way of life."
unionstate.4.a:0 "Sign the document."
unionstate.5.t:0 "American Union War Industry"
unionstate.5.d:0 "Long was opposed to converting all the American Union industry to the war effort. The people were important to Long but the needs of the industry may be more important."
unionstate.5.a:0 "Total war it is."
unionstate.5.b:0 "Butter before guns."
unionstate.6.t:0 "The CSA Escapes to France"
unionstate.6.d:0 "Reed and the CSA leadership were forced to flee to the Commune of France to escape the wrath of the victorious American Union State."
unionstate.6.a:0 "He better not return"
unionstate.7.t:0 "Long and the PSA Leadership"
unionstate.7.d:0 "After the end of the civil war, the question of the PSA leadership was put before Long. The insolence of the PSA leadership needed to be punished but it could alienate the west coast and cause further problems. If the PSA leadership was removed, the industry of the west coast would be available but the expertise of the pacific industries would be diminished."
unionstate.7.a:0 "Hang them all"
unionstate.7.b:0 "Amnesty it is"
unionstate.8.t:0 "US Government in Exile"
unionstate.8.d:0 "The victory of America First over the US government has forced them to flee from the country to Canada. The government has vowed to keep on fighting but without a firm power base there is very little chance of making a difference."
unionstate.8.a:0 "Ha."
unionstate.9.t:0 "The Beacon of the New America"
unionstate.9.d:0 "Long wanted to show the world that the old and corrupt America was gone. He chose to make his hometown, New Orleans, the beacon of the new America. The city would undergo a massive transformation, new streets and buildings would make it the most modern city in the Americas and a massive shipyard would make it the hub of trade in the south. The massive shipyard would also be the birthplace of the new US navy which would safeguard America's future. Critics however thought the plan would be too expensive."
unionstate.9.a:0 "No expense will stop this"
unionstate.9.b:0 "A pipe dream in the end"
unionstate.12.t:0 "Long's Tariff"
unionstate.12.d:0 "To encourage the expansion of American industry, Long planned on implementing a hefty tariff on imported goods. He was warned that the tariff may be worse for the economy in the end."
unionstate.12.a:0 "Implement the tariff"
unionstate.12.b:0 "We can do without this"
unionstate.13.t:0 "American Union Recession"
unionstate.13.d:0 "Long's tariff had initially helped build a greater reliance on American industry but it was unsustainable in the long run. The American Union State fell into recession and unemployment began to rise."
unionstate.13.a:0 "Damn."
unionstate.10.t:0 "Share Our Wealth"
unionstate.10.d:0 "Long's plan was to make every man a king. He would tax those who were holders of excessive wealth and use the money to provide public works projects and social services to all Americans. Extreme members of the party saw this as nothing more than a socialist betrayal and threatened trouble against Long if he proceeded."
unionstate.10.a:0 "Proceed with the plan."
unionstate.10.b:0 "We need the extremists"
unionstate.14.t:0 "Show Trials"
unionstate.14.d:0 "American socialism had been defeated and now Long was going to make them pay the price. Socialists, Anarchists, and anyone who had supported the CSA had been subject to prosecution by the American Union State. Minute Men began rounding up members of the left and special tribunals were setup. These were nothing more than show trials that humiliated and lambasted the accused."
unionstate.14.a:0 "Hang them all!"
unionstate.14.b:0 "Exile the bastards"



unionstate.11.t:0 "The Poll Tax"
unionstate.11.d:0 "Long wished to abolish the Poll Tax to reduce the racial tensions of the south. His proposal was met with immediate condemnation by the extremists within his party. Pelley and others denounced Long as trying to destroy the sacred institutions of the South. Long retorted that racist and sacred were two different things and rallied the people against what he saw as an evil institution."
unionstate.11.a:0 "Abolish the damn thing."
unionstate.11.b:0 "No. We need to maintain the party."
unionstate.16.t:0 "The Long Night"
unionstate.16.d:0 "The rift between Long and Pelley had been growing since before the Civil War and with the Civil War over their differences grew more and more. Pelley moved against him. In the dark of night in New Orleans, Pelley and his goons put into place their plot to assassinate Long and wrest power away from Long. Soon enough...."
unionstate.16.a:0 "The Minutemen rush in and arrest Pelley and the Traitors!"
unionstate.16.b:0 "The Minutemen rush and find Long dead!"



unionstate.17.t:0 "The Industrial Security Act"
unionstate.17.d:0 "The Industrial Security Act was Long's answer to the trade unions of the north. The act would make any disruption of essential industries by work stoppages a conspiracy to commit industrial sabotage and would be punishable by imprisonment. The wording on the act was intentionally vague to give the President a highly effective means with which to defeat the unions."
unionstate.17.a:0 "Pass the act"
unionstate.17.b:0 "This is too much"
unionstate.18.t:0 "Industrial Decentralisation Act"
unionstate.18.d:0 "Long had seen the rust belt as being corrupted by the trade unions and socialists. The amount of industry in the rust belt had given the syndicates a large advantage against the former US government and Long wanted to ensure that this did not happen again. A plan was put forward to move the industry from the rust belt into the mid-west and south to defeat the corruption of the Rust Belt and further castrate the trade unions."
unionstate.18.a:0 "Pass the act"
unionstate.18.b:0 "We should avoid this."
unionstate.19.t:0 "Industrial Resources"
unionstate.19.d:0 "The American Union State government has come into possession of resources that were left behind. They will help our government in the future."
unionstate.19.a:0 "Excellent"
unionstate.20.t:0 "The Grand Council of the America First Union Party"
unionstate.20.d:0 "The America First Union Party is the only party of the American Union State and is governed by the Grand Council of the America First Union Party. The council elects the Secretary of the America First Union Party who is the Head of the Government and the right hand of the Father of the Nation, Huey Long."
unionstate.20.a:0 "One country, one party."
unionstate.21.t:0 "The House of Representatives and the House of Corporations"
unionstate.21.d:0 "The Congress of American Union State has two chambers. The House of Representatives and the House of Corporations. Members of the House of Representatives are chosen on direct elections whereas those of the House of Corporations are chosen by interest groups, who also choose the Speaker of the House of Corporations (who acts as Minister of Armament)."
unionstate.21.a:0 "A new Congress!"
unionstate.22.t:0 "The Supreme Court"
unionstate.22.d:0 "The Supreme Court represents the just system of the American Union State. Its duty is not only to charge and convict those guilty of treason and crime against the state, but also to review normal cases of national importance. The Chairman of the Supreme Court is the Minister of Security."
unionstate.22.a:0 "Justice for all!"
unionstate.23.t:0 "The 1940 elections"
unionstate.23.d:0 "It is now time for the first free elections in the American Union State. The Grand Council of the America First Union Party, the House of Representatives, the House of Corporations and the Supreme Court will be renewed as from now on will happen once every 7 years. Let the elections begin!"
unionstate.23.a:0 "We are a free country!"
unionstate.24.t:0 "The Grand Council of the America First Union Party"
unionstate.24.d:0 "The America First Union Party must choose its direction. Lindbergh wants a more open and democratic country, Long and Smith are concentrated on the economic development of the nation, Coughlin want to focus on the internal affairs of the country. Kuhn's militaristic rhetoric is more interventionist."
unionstate.24.a:0 "Lindbergh's faction will lead the party"
unionstate.24.b:0 "Long's and Smith's faction will lead the party"
unionstate.24.c:0 "Father Coughlin's faction will lead the party"
unionstate.24.e:0 "Kuhn's faction will lead the party"

unionstate.36.d:0 "With the American Union State firmly established, defeating the syndicates in Central and South America was necessary to ensure the security of the new state. A strong position would allow for interventionism against the syndicates before they could successfully secure a position in the Western Hemisphere.

unionstate.38.d:0 "With the fall of Berlin serious questions about the American Union's security were raised. Syndicate domination of Europe was not in the American Union's best interest.

unionstate.40.t:0 "Canada Responds to the AUS Demands"
unionstate.40.d:0 "The alliance between New England and Canada had been one of opportunity but the demand made by the AUS caused strain.

unionstate.50.d:0 "The American Union state had been victorious in the war and now was forced to deal with the PSA.

unionstate.51.t:0 "The Mexican Question"
unionstate.51.d:0 "With territory of the former USA under our firm control, time has come to directly implement the Long doctrine and eradicate syndicalism from America. We should start with our southern neighbour - Mexico. The incompetence of the previous governments allowed Syndicalism to root deeply within Mexican society. The only way how to solve this matter is direct military confrontation..."

A new day is rising in America, and Long's presence is felt everywhere even if it is not seen. America is still a republic and democracy still exists, but the American First Party dominates. The ever fickle American mob is sated by Long's Populism and peace and order has returned to America. "
