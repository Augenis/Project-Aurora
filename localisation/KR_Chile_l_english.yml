chl.3.d:0 "After the Saltpetre War 1879 - 1883 in which Chile received the Peruvian saltpetre provinces Tarapacá and Arica in addition to the Bolivian coastal region of Antofagasta the country had command over vast copper deposits and monopolised the world trade in saltpetre. A phase of economic prosperity was initiated, supported by the high demand for saltpetre at the beginning of Weltkrieg. However, the chemical processes devised during that war to artificially produce saltpetre rendered Chile's deposits worthless. Worsening economic circumstances, together with the growth of the population increased social crisis. Workers and unions gained political influence. President Arturo Alessandri y Palma (1920 -1925, 1932 - 1938) tried to overcome the social tensions. A new constitution expanded the president's powers at the cost of the congress' authority."
