### Events ###
chl.1.t:0 "Earthquake in Chile"
chl.1.d:0 "An earthquake in Chile killed 30.000 people and thousands of people are left homeless. We should do something to help them."
chl.1.a:0 "Help the survivors!"
chl.1.b:0 "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of these unlucky few"
chl.2.t:0 "The Third Chairman"
chl.2.d:0 "Our young republic now holds it's second central elections; much fanfare and celebration is held, and 3 main candidates attempt to sway the votes of the workers. Blest Riffo, a long time fighter of worker's rights during the worst times of repression, is favoured both by Marmaduke and most of the mainline Syndicalists, and thus the majority of voters. Against him runs the young Salvador Allende, whose very opposition broad coalition us as diverse as it is rather uncoheisive, but they promise a better future for Chile. Also, with rather diminute chances, the Totalists, influenced by the ideas of European Socialists like Mosley and Beira, are running with Labarca as their frontman. What will the people decide?"
chl.2.a:0 "Clotario Blest Riffo and the Orthodox Syndicalists"
chl.2.b:0 "Salvador Allende and the Social Coalition"
chl.2.c:0 "Carlos Labarca and the Mosleyists"
chl.3.t:0 "Chile in 1936"
chl.3.d:0 "After the Saltpetre War 1879 - 1883 in which Chile received the Peruvian saltpetre provinces Tarapacá and Arica in addition to the Bolivian coastal region of Antofagasta the country had command over vast copper deposits and monopolised the world trade in saltpetre. A phase of economic prosperity was initiated, supported by the high demand for saltpetre at the beginning of Weltkrieg. However, the chemical processes devised during that war to artificially produce saltpetre rendered Chile's deposits worthless. Worsening economic circumstances, together with the growth of the population increased social crisis. Workers and unions gained political influence, especially under the disastrous rule of Carlos Ibañez Del Campo, during which Chile bankrupted, in 1931. Shortly afterwards. Ibañez was deposed, and the navy and most of the army mutinied, and with the support of the people, and the of arrival of reinforcements from the long exiled Marmaduke Grove arriving from the Union of Britain, the Syndicalist Republic of Chile was proclaimed. After 5 years of rebuilding under the first council, led at least nominally by Arturo Puga, the republic economy recovered greatly, and a military build-up has begun after the Platine War. Now, with La Plata's rhetoric becoming increasingly aggressive, the well respected Marmaduke Grove, military man veteran of two revolutions oceans apart, is at the helm of the rebuilding you republic. However, not all Chileans are as hopeful for the future as the syndical leaders are..."
chl.3.a:0 "The Light of Syndicalism will guide us to the future, whatever it may hold"
chl.4.t:0 "The Fourth Chairman"
chl.4.d:0 "After 10 years of a stable government, the people of Chile rejoice at the prosperity and peace the revolution brought. And now comes the time to elect the Fourth Chairman of the Chilean Syndicalist Republic. Four candidates are running the ballot, and 3 of them are respected and well regarded poets and writers. Gabriela Mistral leads the Pacto de Calais, a broad coalition of intellectuals and politicans who defend the Republic's central government, but unlike Pablo de Rokha's Totalists, do see regular elections and personal freedoms as of something of the utmost importance. The Orthodox Syndicalists are led by Pablo Neruda, yet another very accomplished writer and poet. Meanwhile, the broad Social Front led by Aurelio Celedon Palma has gained some momentum, especially with the rise of autonomist sentiments in the southern half of the nation. But who will win the Poet's Brawl, as the press likes calling this heated contest?

chl.4.b:0 "Pablo Neruda and the Orthodox Syndicalists"
chl.4.c:0 "Aurelio Celedon Palma and the Social Front"
chl.4.e:0 "Pablo de Rokha and the Mosleyists"
chl.ally.1.t:0 "Chile wishes to join the Internationale"
chl.ally.1.d:0 "The workers revolution in Chile has been greatly successful, a shining model in the Southern Hemisphere of revolutionary ideals. However, they feel threatened by reactionary neighbours and other imperialist threats, and feel like it's high time to join the Internationale"
chl.ally.1.a:0 "Let us welcome then in the struggle for World Revolution!"
chl.ally.1.b:0 "That is pointless!"
chl.ally.2.t:0 "Chile wishes to join our Alliance"
chl.ally.2.d:0 "Chile's revolutionary government has shifted it's stance to one that aligns with local syndicalist regimes after their elections, and thus they naturally came to us, asking for a military alliance"
chl.ally.2.a:0 "The end of the La Plata union is just the beginning! Avante!"
chl.ally.2.b:0 "That is pointless!"
