### Events ###
ott.1.t:0 "The Eternal State"
ott.1.d:0 "Once the greatest empire in existence, spanning three continents and ruling over millions of people the Ottoman Empire had declined by the late 19th century, to the point of being known as the 'sick man of europe'. An inability to industrialise, the inexistence of an educated middle-class, and a chronic lack of funds meant that the Ottoman State had dropped back well behind the European powers by 1876, when Abdülhamid II took the throne. At the time, the Ottoman army was still reeling from the shock of Russo-Turkish war of 1877, the Ottoman treasury had just declared bankrupcy and several interest groups were scheming to obtain political control of the Empire. These weaknesses led the Empire to seek closer cooperation with European powers. Prussian military successes against France led the Empire to form military and economic ties with the Germans, culminating in the construction of the Berlin-Baghdad railway in 1888. During his reign Abdülhamid II launched massive education programs and made desperate diplomatic maneuvers to keep his Empire intact; while at the same time he engaged in systematic repression of opposition groups in an effort to maintain his absolute rule. Despite these efforts, a revolt of 'The Young Turks' in 1908, the subsequent dethronement of Abdülhamid II in 1909, and a bloody coup in 1913 meant that in the days leading to the Weltkrieg, The Ottoman Empire was ruled by a corrupt triumvirate of 'Three Pashas'; Enver, Talat and Cemal. In 1914, as the Weltkrieg began in Europe, the Young Turk government signed a secret treaty with the Germans and soon after joined the war against the Entente powers..."
ott.1.a:0 "God save the Empire..."

ott.2.t:0 "Black Monday hits Ottoman Empire!"
ott.2.d:0 "Almost a month ago, the Berlin Stock Exchange plunged into bottomless depths, throwing the economy of the German Empire into an unprecedented crisis. Now the shock waves of the crash have reached the Ottoman Empire. German and Austrian-owned companies have closed down or laid-off their workers, the Ottoman lira is losing it's already-low value, and resource exports are shrinking. Our unstable economy is on the verge of collapse..."
ott.2.a:0 "Great Allah protect us!"

ott.3.t:0 "Initial stabilisation"
ott.3.d:0 "With the first wave of the crisis slowly passing by, some less affected branches of the economy have bounced back from the bottom. Still, the overall state of our economy does not look optimistic..."
ott.3.a:0 "Let's hope stabilisation will come soon.."

ott.4.t:0 "Government intervention"
ott.4.d:0 "With at least partial political stabilisation finally in place, we are prepared to enact a series of intensive reforms, aimed at restoring pre-crisis industrial power."
ott.4.a:0 "Excellent!"

ott.5.t:0 "Further stabilisation"
ott.5.d:0 "Thanks to renewed interest of foreign companies, our economy continues to regain pre-crisis efficiency."
ott.5.a:0 "Keep it up!"

ott.6.t:0 "Request of the International Jewish Lobby"
ott.6.d:0 "The Ottoman authorities have always welcomed the Jews. Since the reign of Sultan Bayezid II, who allowed the settlement of the Iberian Jews in his lands after their expulsion from Spain, they have been an integral part of the empire. However, since the rise of Zionism, laws have been passed to prevent the mass settlement of foreign Jews in Palestine, while avoiding restriction on their pilgrimages. Recently we have been approached by an international Jewish lobby, asking for less constricting laws."
ott.6.a:0 "Very well, allow limited settlement of foreign Jews in Palestine"
ott.6.b:0 "Grant complete freedom of settlement to all non-Ottoman Jews"
ott.6.c:0 "We will not jeopardise the stability of Palestine!"

ott.7.t:0 "Settlers in Palestine"
ott.7.d:0 "The incredible number of Jews who flocked towards Palestine after the passage of new Settlement Laws caused a drastic demographic change in the region. Since their settlement in Jerusalem and the environs, it has become clear that Hebrew is rapidly becoming the second, and some might even argue first language of Palestine. The ideals of Zionism have also entered our lands, and several Judaic factions have already requested increasing amounts of autonomy, even verging on demands for independence."
ott.7.a:0 "Our greatness came from centralised government, not giving away power!"
ott.7.b:0 "Grant them local autonomy"

ott.8.t:0 "The Great Arabian Revolt!"
ott.8.d:0 "In the middle of 1944, faced with mounting oppression from their Turkish masters, several Arab cities erupted in open revolt. Mobs began burning down Ottoman institutions and raided police and military bases. From Baghdad to Jerusalem, Arabs have risen up against the Ottoman Empire."
ott.8.a:0 "We will crush them!"

ott.9.t:0 "Second Arabian Revolt!"
ott.9.d:0 "In the middle of 1946 several Arabian tribes united their efforts to destabilise the Ottoman Empire again. Will it succeed this time?"
ott.9.a:0 "We will crush them again!"

ott.10.t:0 "Arabian Revolt Crushed"
ott.10.d:0 "Rejoice! Our invincible armies have successfully defeated the Bedouin rabble. Once again their uprising was futile."
ott.10.a:0 "Those ungrateful rebels will never learn from the past!"

ott.11.t:0 "Arabian Revolt successful!"
ott.11.d:0 "The Syrian and Iraqi nationalist movements have defeated our armies and even begun to occupy our lands! Shall we offer them peace?"
ott.11.a:0 "Accept their independence, we have been beaten..."
ott.11.b:0 "Keep fighting!"

ott.12.t:0 "Nationalist Rebels Successful"
ott.12.d:0 "This is a great victory and all, but why are you reading through the localisation file entries of a hidden event in an obscure wehraboo mod that nobody actually plays?"
ott.12.a:0 "Oh shid you caught me :DDDD"

ott.13.t:0 "Status Quo Ante Bellum"
ott.13.d:0 "After narrowly escaping defeat and destruction in the Weltkrieg, the Ottomans found that they had lost much for little gain. Suffering through 12 years of war, disease and poverty, the Ottoman Empire had gained nothing to show for it. Following the gloomy conclusion of the disastrous war, Enver, Talat and Cemal Pashas attempted to reinforce their authority, but the Committee of Union and Progress dictatorship had lost all credibility by then. Added to this was the immense German pressure to prosecute the Young Turk war criminals responsible for massacring minorities in the east. This quickly led to the downfall of the triumvirate, who escaped abroad, only to be tracked down and assassinated by Armenian avengers. German political and military pressure soon led to the appointment of a loyalist government under Damat Ferit Pasha, who led the efforts to bring war criminals to court. Through German intervention, the Ottoman Sultan had regained a semblance of authority, albeit weak. Unfortunately the Germans had an interest in maintaining the status quo and so consistently backed the monarchy in any clashes with opposition groups, while at the same time letting Sultan Mehmed VI know that noncompliance on his part would lead to a withdrawal of their support. In 1936 then the Empire is staggering and slipping. More and more groups demanding reforms are appearing, to be joined by various nationalist groups intent on achieving independence. Economically too it is reliant on German support, especially the oil trade from the Middle East. In other words the Ottoman Empire is now the 'terminally ill man of Europe'."
ott.13.a:0 "Calm before the storm..."

ott.14.t:0 "Our lands expand"
ott.14.d:0 "Following years of contention involving domestic Arab nationalists, the Ottoman Empire has released several of its provinces to our control."
ott.14.a:0 "Good for them!"

ott.15.t:0 "Nawruz Day Riots"
ott.15.d:0 "Dissatisfaction in the Kurdish parts of our empire has reached a boiling point, with many demanding greater autonomy and some going as far as to demand outright independence. The March 21st is an important date for these separatists, as it marks the day of traditional spring festivities and the Persian New Year. During this year's Nawruz celebrations, a seemingly small incident in Diyarbakır quickly got out of hand and turned into large-scale revolt. Protests and riots are erupting across our Kurdish provinces, and while we have reason to suspect the syndicalists are behind it all, many Kurdish landowners and tribes have declared their support for the movement as well."
ott.15.a:0 "This does not look good..."

ott.16.t:0 "Kurdish Uprising"
ott.16.d:0 "As the Ottoman Gendarmerie failed to defuse the situation, Kurdish riots grew day by day. The rebellious Kurdish subjects of the Sultan had grown tired of the repression and lack of autonomy. Open uprisings were reported in all Kurdish majority areas of the Empire. Could this be the final blow to Sick man of Europe?"
ott.16.a:0 "We'll See..."

ott.17.t:0 "Report from the East"
ott.17.d:0 "With regions inhabitated by Kurds in open rebellion, the stability of the Ottoman Empire is on the verge of collapse since one succesful uprising can cause a Domino effect in our Arabian provinces and subject states. We must crush this uprising quickly."
ott.17.a:0 "Crush the enemies of the Devlet-i Aliye!"
ott.17.b:0 "Perhaps they deserve independence..."

ott.18.t:0 "Kurdish uprising crushed!"
ott.18.d:0 "Our military has successfully taken control of all Kurdish national territory. Once again their uprising was futile."
ott.18.a:0 "These Kurds will never learn from the past!"

ott.19.t:0 "Kurdistan still exists!"
ott.19.d:0 "Even the concentration of our elite armed forces could not break apart the rebellious state of Kurdistan. Some members of the general staff suggest that continuing with this fruitless effort greatly weakens our forces facing the hostile Arabian states of Hejaz and Egypt. Shall we recognize the independence of Kurdistan?"
ott.19.a:0 "Accept their independence..."
ott.19.b:0 "Never!"

ott.20.t:0 "Kurds leaving to join uprising"
ott.20.d:0 "The eruption of the Kurdish uprising in the Ottoman Empire convinced part of our Kurdish population to leave the country to join the uprising. Shall we allow them to leave our country to join the uprising?"
ott.20.a:0 "Well, who cares?"
ott.20.b:0 "Prevent them from leaving"

ott.21.t:0 "Kurdish volunteers from Persia"
ott.21.d:0 "Our fight for the freedom of the Kurdish nation has attracted the attention of all Kurds. Many have decided to leave their homelands to join our fight for freedom!"
ott.21.a:0 "We need all the help we can get!"

ott.22.t:0 "The Future of Kurdistan"
ott.22.d:0 "After the bloddy liberation war against the Ottomans it is now time to decide the fate of Kurdistan, shall we introduce democracy based on the people's will to Kurdistan, or do we need the stability offered by a monarch to lead us to prosperity?"
ott.22.a:0 "Introduce democracy to Kurdistan!"
ott.22.b:0 "A Kurdish King shall bring stability!"

ott.23.t:0 "General Elections in Kurdistan!"
ott.23.d:0 "Since the beginning of the struggle for freedom many different parties have claimed that they are the one true ruler of Kurdistan. Four big parties have a chance of winning, Partiya Sosyalisti, a radical socialistic party. The second party is the Partiya Demokrate Kurdistan, a social conservative party. The third option is the Partiya Azadi, a social democratic party! The last choice is the radical Partiya Serbokho, a nationalist party."
ott.23.a:0 "Solidarity, Brotherhood and Freedom! Partiya Sosyalisti"
ott.23.b:0 "Democracy and Freedom! Partiya Demokrate Kurdistan!"
ott.23.c:0 "Farms, Industries and Development! Partiya Azadi!"
ott.23.e:0 "Our People, Our Land, Our Future! Partiya Serbokho!"

ott.24.t:0 "Foreign Affairs"
ott.24.d:0 "During the election Partiya Sosyalisti said that if they would win they would seek protection and cooperation from the Internationale, now it is time to decide if we should do so or remain in isolation."
ott.24.a:0 "Try to join the Internationale"
ott.24.b:0 "Isolationism will protect Kurdistan"

ott.25.t:0 "Kurdistan wants to join the Internationale"
ott.25.d:0 "Our Socialist friends in Kurdistan want to join the Internationale, hoping that membership in our alliance will protect the independence of their newborn state. Although some eager officers are arguing for the immediate acceptance of Kurdistan into the Internationale, most of them are against such a drastic move, and opt for a simple guarantee of their independence."
ott.25.a:0 "Invite Kurdistan into the Internationale!"
ott.25.b:0 "Just guarantee their independence."
ott.25.c:0 "No, we have no interests there."

ott.26.t:0 "Kurdistan joins the Internationale"
ott.26.d:0 "France accepted our offer and now we are a member of the Internationale! Membership in such a powerful military alliance will definitely ensure our independence. Viva la Internationale!"
ott.26.a:0 "Biji Biji!"

ott.27.t:0 "Kurdistan receives formal guarantee"
ott.27.d:0 "Our French comrades are reluctant to make us a full member of the Internationale, for now they have decided to guarantee our independence instead."
ott.27.a:0 "That's something, at least..."

ott.28.t:0 "Kurdistan receives formal rejection!"
ott.28.d:0 "Unbelievable! Those fascists in the Commune of France have rejected our request to join the Internationale!"

ott.31.a:0 "C'mon guys, I thought we are all Muslims in here?"

ott.32.t:0 "25th Anniversary of War Sparks Riots"
ott.32.d:0 "The 25th anniversary of our entry into the Weltkrieg has sparked angry riots as Arab nationalists take to the streets to show their discontent with the Ottoman government. Police are having a hard time keeping control of the situation and many local officers have joined the rioters."

ott.40.t:0 "Cypriot Uprising!"
ott.40.d:0 "With regions inhabitated by Cypriot Greeks declaring independence from us, the stability of our empire is further endangered. Turkish Cypriots are organising in the north, and this could give us the opportunity to send reinforcements before the Greek forces manage overrun the whole island. We must crush this uprising quickly."
ott.40.a:0 "Very well, commence Operation Atilla."
ott.40.b:0 "Let them have their independence..."

ott.41.t:0 "Cypriot uprising crushed!"
ott.41.d:0 "Our military has succesfully taken control of Cyprus. Once again their uprising was futile."
ott.41.a:0 "These Greeks will never learn from the past!"

ott.42.t:0 "Destroying the Cypriot fortifications"
ott.42.d:0 "The Cypriot uprising was crushed by our invincible army, but in some parts of their territory, the forts remained. These are useless for us but future rebels could use them - against us. What shall we do?"
ott.42.a:0 "Destroy them! And carve the Ottoman flag into the mountain while you are at it..."

ott.43.t:0 "Greek Cypriots succesfully resist!"
ott.43.d:0 "Our armed forces could not break apart the rebellious state of Cyprus. Some members of the general staff suggest that continuing with this fruitless effort greatly weakens our forces facing the hostile Arabian states of Hashemite Arabia and Egypt. Shall we recognise the independence of Cyprus?"
ott.43.a:0 "Accept their independence..."
ott.43.b:0 "Never!"

ott.44.t:0 "Send aid to our brothers in Cyprus?"
ott.44.d:0 "The Greek inhabitants of Cyprus people have risen against their Ottoman overlords, wanting to finally break free from them. This presents us with the option to significantly weaken the Ottoman Empire via supporting the Cypriot independence movement..."
ott.44.a:0 "Send aid to Cyprus!"
ott.44.b:0 "We cannot do anything..."

ott.45.t:0 "Aid from Greece"
ott.45.d:0 "Greece has sent us large amounts of supplies and volunteers eager to help us prevail against the Ottoman Empire!"
ott.45.a:0 "Great!"

ott.46.t:0 "End of the Cypriot war"
ott.46.d:0 "For good or ill, the Cypriot war is now over.  The General Staff has reported that they learned many valuable lessons regarding the nature of modern warfare over the course of the conflict."
ott.46.a:0 "Great!"

ott.47.t:0 "Foreign policy"
ott.47.d:0 "With our independence secured, it is now time to decide our foreign orientation. Currently we can try to reunite with Greece as we tried in past, or maintain our independence and remain in isolation."
ott.47.a:0 "We must reunite with Greece!"
ott.47.b:0 "Cyprus shall stand alone!"

ott.48.t:0 "Cyprus wishes unification"
ott.48.d:0 "After years of Ottoman occupation, the people of Cyprus have decided to throw off the shackles of Ottoman oppression and unify with us."
ott.48.a:0 "Annex Cyprus!"
ott.48.b:0 "It is too risky"

ott.49.t:0 "Status of Armenia"
ott.49.d:0 "For many years, the Ottomans have been free to impose their tyrannical will over us. Today, problems have arisen for the Ottomans, and this presents as with a chance to free ourselves from Ottoman dominance once and for all and establish a free and independent Armenia."
ott.49.a:0 "Declare complete independence from the Ottomans!"
ott.49.b:0 "The time is not right!"

ott.50.t:0 "Armenia declares independence!"
ott.50.d:0 "For many years, we have ruled over Armenia. But today, with our country engaged in a lengthy conflict, Armenia has decided to use this opportunity to break from our dominance, inciting riots in the eastern parts of our empire inhabited by Armenian minorities in the process. How should we react to this mess?"
ott.50.a:0 "Crush this upstart!"
ott.50.b:0 "Let them go"

ott.51.t:0 "Armenia still exists!"
ott.51.d:0 "Even the concentration of our elite armed forces could not break apart the rebellious state of Armenia. Some members of the general staff suggest that continuing with this fruitless effort greatly weakens our forces facing the hostile Arabian states of Hashemite Arabia and Egypt. Shall we recognize the independence of Armenia?"
ott.51.a:0 "Accept their independence..."
ott.51.b:0 "Never!"

ott.52.t:0 "German Empire in disarray"
ott.52.d:0 "With the German Empire in turmoil, we have a great opportunity to seize control of Aden. There is very little that the German Empire can do to stop us at this point."
ott.52.a:0 "Seize control of Aden!"
ott.52.b:0 "Rather not"

ott.53.t:0 "Yemen takes control of Aden!"
ott.53.d:0 "With our empire in chaos, Yemen used this opportunity to seize control of Aden. There is very little that we can do to stop Yemen at this point."
ott.53.a:0 "There is nothing we can do"

ott.55.t:0 "The Treaty of Jerusalem"
ott.55.d:0 "We've successfully beaten the armed forces of the Ottoman Empire and conquered large parts of their empire. Now the humiliated Ottoman leadership offers us peace in which they promise to recognise our territorial gains and withdraw from the disputed territory. How shall we react?"

ott.55.b:0 "No, the war will continue until our army marches through Kostantiniyye!"

ott.56.t:0 "The Treaty of Jerusalem"
ott.56.d:0 "According to the Treaty of Jerusalem we must withdraw our force from the remaining parts of our Arabian provinces..."
ott.56.a:0 "How humiliating!"

ott.57.t:0 "The Arabs refused to sign the treaty!"

ott.63.a:0 "Great!"

ott.64.t:0 "The Treaty of Beyrut"
ott.64.d:0 "Our attempt to crush Ottoman Empire together with our allies from the Arabian bloc failed miserably! After our initial advance the armed forces of the Ottoman Empire counter-attacked and have driven us from all our captured territory. We should offer peace to them while we can!"

ott.79.t:0 "Ottomans request Aircraft Designs"
ott.79.d:0 "Our old ally, The Ottoman Empire, wants to buy military aircraft designs from German companies. Several aircraft manufacturers have notified us because German law states that the sale of weapons to foreign buyers must be approved by the government first. Shall we allow our companies to sell aircraft blueprints to the Turks?"
ott.79.a:0 "Very well, you may sell them some old designs"
ott.79.b:0 "No, we do not give away industrial secrets"

ott.80.t:0 "German Air Designs"
ott.80.d:0 "The Germans have approved the deal! It was not cheap, but we finally possess the necessary technical information to design our own modern aircraft."
ott.80.a:0 "To the skies!"

ott.81.t:0 "German Air Designs"
ott.81.d:0 "The German government has refused the deal! Even though we reached an agreement with the aircraft manufacturers, the barbaric German government refused to allow the trade. This is an unexpected setback for our air program."

ott.82.t:0 "Black Sea Naval Supremacy"
ott.82.d:0 "'The Black Sea would storm / As it looked at the Turkish flag!' \nExpansion and modernisation of our naval bases on the Marmara and Black Sea coasts appear to have tipped the regional balance of power in our favor. As we now have a firm grip on their access to Mediterranean, other navies of the Black Sea are visibly bewildered; and the pair of 355mm Krupp guns we installed on Rumeli and Anadolu Hisarı just add insult to the injury."
ott.82.a:0 "Give way to the flag of the Turk!"

ott.83.t:0 "Eastern Mediterranean Naval Supremacy"
ott.83.d:0 "Our new and expanded naval facilities in Beirut are now fully operational. Initial reactions from other navies of the region suggest they are well aware of our expanded area of influence. As we now have the initiative, we must not let it slip."
ott.83.a:0 "Ah, those Mediterranean nights..."

ott.84.t:0 "Gulf of Basra Naval Supremacy"
ott.84.d:0 "Our expanded naval facilities in Basra and Kuwait are now operational. These ports are crucial for our oil trade, just as they were crucial for the spice trade in medieval times. Our solidified control is already causing quite a stir in the region."

ott.85.t:0 "The Sultan's Speech"
ott.85.d:0 "His Majesty the Sultan [Root.GetLeader] delivered an Imperial Address in the Ottoman House of Commons today, recalling the events of the last decade and outlining his great plans for the future. The brief and eloquent speech had a spectacular effect on the multitude of state officials who had gathered to hear the Sultan speak - the several minutes of applause that followed the oration could be heard from across the Bosporus. In his magnificent 'Nutk-ı Hümayun', His Imperial Majesty had talked a great deal about many important subjects like democracy and the parliament, and yet nobody knew what exactly was on the Sultan's mind."
ott.85.a:0 "A sign of great things to come"

ott.86.t:0 "Ottoman Parliament Dissolved"
ott.86.d:0 "At [GetDateText], soldiers entered the Cemile Sultan Palace to disband the Ottoman Parliament. Citing the Imperial Decree of Sultan [Root.GetLeader], Ottoman inzibat units ended the session by force, and all members of parliament were escorted outside the palace grounds. Another 'İrâde-i Seniyye' that went into effect an hour later effectively suspended the constitution and enforced a media blackout that aimed to suppress all information about the dissolvement of the Ottoman Chamber of Deputies. Nevertheless, the news quickly spread throughout the capital and the rest of the empire. Though many viewed this as an irrational and impulsive move on part of [Root.GetLeader], some liberal groups were convinced that this was only the beginning of the end."
ott.86.a:0 "No longer shall we suffer from two-headedness"

ott.87.t:0 "Shut down the political parties?"
ott.87.d:0 "Following the dissolvement of the Parliament, political parties of all ideologies began criticising the decision, with liberal ideologues even going so far as to call the Imperial Decrees 'tyrannical'. Opposition to the Sultan is growing day by day, and even the resident monarchists in the Selamet-i Osmaniye Party are having a hard time defending the situation, meanwhile several spontaneous protests have materialized in the capital. Should we really allow these pesky agitators to roam free in the city?"
ott.87.a:0 "Proceed with the arrests of politicians"
ott.87.b:0 "Allow them to exist and operate freely"

ott.88.t:0 "Protesters gather in front of Dolmabahçe Palace"
ott.88.d:0 "An angry crowd gathered in front of the Imperial Palace today, demanding that the government reinstate the constitution and the Chamber of Deputies. This may be the beginning of something bad..."
ott.88.a:0 "Arrest these filthy marauders"
ott.88.b:0 "Do nothing, they will give up eventually"

ott.89.t:0 "The Beşiktaş Massacre"
ott.89.d:0 "Attempts to arrest protesters and end the riots rapidly took a turn for the worse as an army patrol opened fire on hostile protesters in the Beşiktaş district of Istanbul late last night. Although the soldiers involved claim that they felt genuinely threatened and fired only when the mob advanced, the public is unlikely to believe their story."
ott.89.a:0 "This does not bode well..."

ott.90.t:0 "The New Reformers?"
ott.90.d:0 "The massacre at Beşiktaş provoked a major outrage from the public. Following a series of threats from more extremist and disgruntled sectors of our society, major opposition parties, and also pressure from the army high command, the undersecretary of Ministry of the Interior proposed the reinstation of Constitution, and a major reshuffling of our government in order to appease the dissenters and maybe bring some stability back to the Empire. Shall we proceed?"
ott.90.a:0 "What are you waiting for? Swear them in!"
ott.90.b:0 "Supress the malcontents by force of arms!"

ott.91.t:0 "Mob violence erupts in Kostantiniyye"
ott.91.d:0 "General unrest has turned into rioting and mob rule in our capital! Various left-wing groups were spotted among the rioters as protesters started damaging public buildings and clashed with the security forces. As the initially civil protests quickly deteriorated into anarchy and vandalism, they began to lose their support among the conservative sections of the Ottoman public. Reports of drunk rebels loitering near the Dolmabahçe Palace and its attached Mosque were quickly publicised by pro-government newspapers."
ott.91.a:0 "Those drunks entered the mosque with their shoes on!"

ott.92.t:0 "Prince Sabahaddin Agitates!"
ott.92.d:0 "Prince Mehmed Sabahaddin, leader of the Liberal Entente, has started organizing protests against what he calls 'The Tyranny of Absolute Rule'. A grandson of Abdülmecid I and related to the House of Osman through his mother, the veteran liberal politician is on the forefront of the opposition movement. It would be wise to drive him out of this country, if our reforms are to succeed..."
ott.92.a:0 "Force him into exile!"
ott.92.b:0 "Let him agitate"

ott.93.t:0 "Organized Opposition"
ott.93.d:0 "Opposition politicians appear to have succeeded in their coordinated efforts to deceive the Ottoman people about our latest leadership reforms, and as a result our popular support is lower than ever..."
ott.93.a:0 "They will not halt our progress!"

ott.94.t:0 "Protests calm down"
ott.94.d:0 "Following several weeks of anarchy and rioting on the streets of Kostantiniyye, the protests eventually died down. While the damage to public buildings and services were minimal, the damage to the credibility of the protesters was immense. The conservative Ottoman public, always wary of chaos and instability, had chosen to side with the Sultan. As a new era dawned on The Ottoman Empire, Sultan [Root.GetLeader] stood strong with the support of the majority behind him."
ott.94.a:0 "We will have order in our Empire!"
