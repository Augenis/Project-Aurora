### Events ###
ott.1.t:0 "The Eternal State"
ott.1.d:0 "Once the greatest empire in existence, spanning three continents and ruling over millions of people the Ottoman Empire had declined by the late 19th century, to the point of being known as the 'sick man of Europe'. An inability to industrialise, the nonexistence of an educated middle-class, and a chronic lack of funds meant that the Ottoman State had dropped back well behind the European powers by 1876, when Abdülhamid II took the throne. At the time, the Ottoman army was still reeling from the shock of Russo-Turkish war of 1877, the Ottoman treasury had just declared bankruptcy and several interest groups were scheming to obtain political control of the Empire. These weaknesses led the Empire to seek closer cooperation with European powers. Prussian military successes against France led the Empire to form military and economic ties with the Germans, culminating in the construction of the Berlin-Baghdad railway in 1888. During his reign Abdülhamid II launched massive education programs and made desperate diplomatic manoeuvres to keep his Empire intact; while at the same time he engaged in systematic repression of opposition groups in an effort to maintain his absolute rule. Despite these efforts, a revolt of 'The Young Turks' in 1908, the subsequent dethronement of Abdülhamid II in 1909, and a bloody coup in 1913 meant that in the days leading to the Weltkrieg, The Ottoman Empire was ruled by a corrupt triumvirate of 'Three Pashas'; Enver, Talat and Cemal. In 1914, as the Weltkrieg began in Europe, the Young Turk government signed a secret treaty with the Germans and soon after joined the war against the Entente powers..."
ott.1.a:0 "God save the Empire..."

ott.2.t:0 "Black Monday hits Ottoman Empire!"
ott.2.d:0 "Almost a month ago, the Berlin Stock Exchange plunged into bottomless depths, throwing the economy of the German Empire into an unprecedented crisis. Now the shock waves of the crash have reached the Ottoman Empire. German and Austrian-owned companies have closed down or laid-off their workers, the Ottoman lira is losing it's already-low value, and resource exports are shrinking. Our unstable economy is on the verge of collapse..."
ott.2.a:0 "Great Allah protect us!"

ott.3.t:0 "Initial stabilisation"
ott.3.d:0 "With the first wave of the crisis slowly passing by, some less affected branches of the economy have bounced back from the bottom. Still, the overall state of our economy does not look optimistic..."
ott.3.a:0 "Let's hope stabilisation will come soon.."

ott.4.t:0 "Government intervention"
ott.4.d:0 "With at least partial political stabilisation finally in place, we are prepared to enact a series of intensive reforms, aimed at restoring pre-crisis industrial power."
ott.4.a:0 "Excellent!"

ott.5.t:0 "Further stabilisation"
ott.5.d:0 "Thanks to renewed interest of foreign companies, our economy continues to regain pre-crisis efficiency."
ott.5.a:0 "Keep it up!"

ott.6.t:0 "Request of the International Jewish Lobby"
ott.6.d:0 "The Ottoman authorities have always welcomed the Jews. Since the reign of Sultan Bayezid II, who allowed the settlement of the Iberian Jews in his lands after their expulsion from Spain, they have been an integral part of the empire. However, since the rise of Zionism, laws have been passed to prevent the mass settlement of foreign Jews in Palestine, while avoiding restriction on their pilgrimages. Recently we have been approached by an international Jewish lobby, asking for less constricting laws."
ott.6.a:0 "Very well, allow limited settlement of foreign Jews in Palestine"
ott.6.b:0 "Grant complete freedom of settlement to all non-Ottoman Jews"
ott.6.c:0 "We will not jeopardise the stability of Palestine!"

ott.7.t:0 "Settlers in Palestine"
ott.7.d:0 "The incredible number of Jews who flocked towards Palestine after the passage of new Settlement Laws caused a drastic demographic change in the region. Since their settlement in Jerusalem and the environs, it has become clear that Hebrew is rapidly becoming the second, and some might even argue first language of Palestine. The ideals of Zionism have also entered our lands, and several Judaic factions have already requested increasing amounts of autonomy, even verging on demands for independence."
ott.7.a:0 "Our greatness came from centralised government, not giving away power!"
ott.7.b:0 "Grant them local autonomy"

ott.8.t:0 "The Great Arabian Revolt!"
ott.8.d:0 "In the middle of 1944, faced with mounting oppression from their Turkish masters, several Arab cities erupted in open revolt. Mobs began burning down Ottoman institutions and raided police and military bases. From Baghdad to Jerusalem, Arabs have risen up against the Ottoman Empire."
ott.8.a:0 "We will crush them!"

ott.9.t:0 "Second Arabian Revolt!"
ott.9.d:0 "In the middle of 1946 several Arabian tribes united their efforts to destabilise the Ottoman Empire again. Will it succeed this time?"
ott.9.a:0 "We will crush them again!"

ott.10.t:0 "Arabian Revolt Crushed"
ott.10.d:0 "Rejoice! Our invincible armies have successfully defeated the Bedouin rabble. Once again their uprising was futile."
ott.10.a:0 "Those ungrateful rebels will never learn from the past!"

ott.11.t:0 "Arabian Revolt successful!"
ott.11.d:0 "The Syrian and Iraqi nationalist movements have defeated our armies and even begun to occupy our lands! Shall we offer them peace?"
ott.11.a:0 "Accept their independence, we have been beaten..."
ott.11.b:0 "Keep fighting!"

ott.12.t:0 "Nationalist Rebels Successful"
ott.12.d:0 "This is a great victory and all, but why are you reading through the localisation file entries of a hidden event in an obscure wehraboo mod that nobody actually plays?"
ott.12.a:0 "Oh shid you caught me :DDDD"

ott.13.t:0 "Status Quo Ante Bellum"
ott.13.d:0 "After narrowly escaping defeat and destruction in the Weltkrieg, the Ottomans found that they had lost much for little gain. Suffering through 12 years of war, disease and poverty, the Ottoman Empire had gained nothing to show for it. Following the gloomy conclusion of the disastrous war, Enver, Talat and Cemal Pashas attempted to reinforce their authority, but the Committee of Union and Progress dictatorship had lost all credibility by then. Added to this was the immense German pressure to prosecute the Young Turk war criminals responsible for massacring minorities in the east. This quickly led to the downfall of the triumvirate, who escaped abroad, only to be tracked down and assassinated by Armenian avengers. German political and military pressure soon led to the appointment of a loyalist government under Damat Ferit Pasha, who led the efforts to bring war criminals to court. Through German intervention, the Ottoman Sultan had regained a semblance of authority, albeit weak. Unfortunately the Germans had an interest in maintaining the status quo and so consistently backed the monarchy in any clashes with opposition groups, while at the same time letting Sultan Mehmed VI know that noncompliance on his part would lead to a withdrawal of their support. In 1936 then the Empire is staggering and slipping. More and more groups demanding reforms are appearing, to be joined by various nationalist groups intent on achieving independence. Economically too it is reliant on German support, especially the oil trade from the Middle East. In other words the Ottoman Empire is now the 'terminally ill man of Europe'."
ott.13.a:0 "Calm before the storm..."

ott.14.t:0 "Our lands expand"
ott.14.d:0 "Following years of contention involving domestic Arab nationalists, the Ottoman Empire has released several of its provinces to our control."
ott.14.a:0 "Good for them!"

ott.15.t:0 "Nawruz Day Riots"
ott.15.d:0 "Dissatisfaction in the Kurdish parts of our empire has reached a boiling point, with many demanding greater autonomy and some going as far as to demand outright independence. The March 21st is an important date for these separatists, as it marks the day of traditional spring festivities and the Persian New Year. During this year's Nawruz celebrations, a seemingly small incident in Diyarbakır quickly got out of hand and turned into large-scale revolt. Protests and riots are erupting across our Kurdish provinces, and while we have reason to suspect the syndicalists are behind it all, many Kurdish landowners and tribes have declared their support for the movement as well."
ott.15.a:0 "This does not look good..."

ott.16.t:0 "Kurdish Uprising"
ott.16.d:0 "As the Ottoman Gendarmerie failed to defuse the situation, Kurdish riots grew day by day. The rebellious Kurdish subjects of the Sultan had grown tired of the repression and lack of autonomy. Open uprisings were reported in all Kurdish majority areas of the Empire. Could this be the final blow to Sick man of Europe?"
ott.16.a:0 "We'll See..."

ott.17.t:0 "Report from the East"
ott.17.d:0 "With regions inhabited by Kurds in open rebellion, the stability of the Ottoman Empire is on the verge of collapse since one successful uprising can cause a Domino effect in our Arabian provinces and subject states. We must crush this uprising quickly."
ott.17.a:0 "Crush the enemies of the Devlet-i Aliye!"
ott.17.b:0 "Perhaps they deserve independence..."

ott.18.t:0 "Kurdish uprising crushed!"
ott.18.d:0 "Our military has successfully taken control of all Kurdish national territory. Once again their uprising was futile."
ott.18.a:0 "These Kurds will never learn from the past!"

ott.19.t:0 "Kurdistan still exists!"
ott.19.d:0 "Even the concentration of our elite armed forces could not break apart the rebellious state of Kurdistan. Some members of the general staff suggest that continuing with this fruitless effort greatly weakens our forces facing the hostile Arabian states of Hejaz and Egypt. Shall we recognize the independence of Kurdistan?"
ott.19.a:0 "Accept their independence..."
ott.19.b:0 "Never!"

ott.20.t:0 "Kurds leaving to join uprising"
ott.20.d:0 "The eruption of the Kurdish uprising in the Ottoman Empire convinced part of our Kurdish population to leave the country to join the uprising. Shall we allow them to leave our country to join the uprising?"
ott.20.a:0 "Well, who cares?"
ott.20.b:0 "Prevent them from leaving"

ott.21.t:0 "Kurdish volunteers from Persia"
ott.21.d:0 "Our fight for the freedom of the Kurdish nation has attracted the attention of all Kurds. Many have decided to leave their homelands to join our fight for freedom!"
ott.21.a:0 "We need all the help we can get!"

ott.22.t:0 "The Future of Kurdistan"
ott.22.d:0 "After the bloddy liberation war against the Ottomans it is now time to decide the fate of Kurdistan, shall we introduce democracy based on the people's will to Kurdistan, or do we need the stability offered by a monarch to lead us to prosperity?"
ott.22.a:0 "Introduce democracy to Kurdistan!"
ott.22.b:0 "A Kurdish King shall bring stability!"

ott.23.t:0 "General Elections in Kurdistan!"
ott.23.d:0 "Since the beginning of the struggle for freedom many different parties have claimed that they are the one true ruler of Kurdistan. Four big parties have a chance of winning, Partiya Sosyalisti, a radical socialistic party. The second party is the Partiya Demokrate Kurdistan, a social conservative party. The third option is the Partiya Azadi, a social democratic party! The last choice is the radical Partiya Serbokho, a nationalist party."
ott.23.a:0 "Solidarity, Brotherhood and Freedom! Partiya Sosyalisti"
ott.23.b:0 "Democracy and Freedom! Partiya Demokrate Kurdistan!"

ott.29.d:0 "Founded in 1881 the Ottoman Public Debt Administration (OPDA) was an European-controlled organisation that monitored and collected debt owed by the Ottoman State to European creditors in the private and public sectors. Most of the debt had been owed to French and British government as well as private institutions and had, as a consequence, been unilaterally defaulted by the Ottoman government when revolution swept away the regimes in London and Paris. However, the OPDA is still in existence and is now fully controlled by German and Austrian administrators, mainly concerned with regaining the capital loaned to Kostantiniyye during the Weltkrieg."

ott.40.t:0 "Cypriot Uprising!"
ott.40.d:0 "With regions inhabited by Cypriot Greeks declaring independence from us, the stability of our empire is further endangered.

ott.43.t:0 "Greek Cypriots successfully resist!"
ott.43.d:0 "Our armed forces could not break apart the rebellious state of Cyprus.

The brief and eloquent speech had a spectacular effect on the multitude of state officials who had gathered to hear the Sultan speak - the several minutes of applause that followed the oration could be heard from across the Bosporus. In his magnificent 'Nutk-ı Hümayun', His Imperial Majesty had talked a great deal about many important subjects like democracy and the parliament, and yet nobody knew what exactly was on the Sultan's mind."

Citing the Imperial Decree of Sultan [Root.GetLeader], Ottoman inzibat units ended the session by force, and all members of parliament were escorted outside the palace grounds. Another 'İrâde-i Seniyye' that went into effect an hour later effectively suspended the constitution and enforced a media blackout that aimed to suppress all information about the dissolvement of the Ottoman Chamber of Deputies. Nevertheless, the news quickly spread throughout the capital and the rest of the empire. Though many viewed this as an irrational and impulsive move on part of [Root.GetLeader], some liberal groups were convinced that this was only the beginning of the end."

ott.87.t:0 "Shut down the political parties?"
ott.87.d:0 "Following the dissolvement of the Parliament, political parties of all ideologies began criticising the decision, with liberal ideologues even going so far as to call the Imperial Decrees 'tyrannical'. Opposition to the Sultan is growing day by day, and even the resident monarchists in the Selamet-i Osmaniye Party are having a hard time defending the situation, meanwhile several spontaneous protests have materialised in the capital. Should we really allow these pesky agitators to roam free in the city?"

ott.89.a:0 "This does not bode well..."

ott.90.t:0 "The New Reformers?"
ott.90.d:0 "The massacre at Galata provoked a major outrage from the public. Following a series of threats from more extremist and disgruntled sectors of our society, major opposition parties, and also pressure from the army high command, the undersecretary of Ministry of the Interior proposed the reinstatement of Constitution, and a major reshuffling of our government in order to appease the dissenters and maybe bring some stability back to the Empire.

ott.91.t:0 "Mob violence erupts in Kostantiniyye"
ott.91.d:0 "General unrest has turned into rioting and mob rule in our capital! Various left-wing groups were spotted among the rioters as protesters clashed with the security forces and started damaging public buildings. As the initially civil protests quickly deteriorated into vandalism and anarchy, they began to lose their support among the conservative sections of the Ottoman public. Reports of inebriated rebels loitering near the Dolmabahçe Palace and its attached Mosque were quickly publicised by pro-government newspapers."

ott.92.t:0 "Prince Sabahaddin Agitates!"

It would be wise to drive him out of this country, if our reforms are to succeed..."

ott.94.t:0 "Protests calm down"
ott.94.d:0 "Following several weeks of anarchy and rioting on the streets of Kostantiniyye, the protests eventually died down. While damage to public buildings and services were minimal, damage to the credibility of the protesters was immense. The conservative Ottoman public, always wary of chaos and instability, had chosen to side with the Sultan. As a new era dawned on The Ottoman Empire, Sultan [Root.GetLeader] stood strong with the support of the majority behind him."

ott.100.t:0 "Ottoman Constitution - Houses of Parliament"
ott.100.d:0 "In the Constitution of 1876, the Houses of Parliament were established comprising of a Lower House (Meclis-i Mebusan) and an Upper House (Meclis-i Âyan). The Grand Vizier, handpicked by the Sultan, presided over the Houses of Parliament. The liberal members of the Committee are arguing that the Grand Vizier (and by extension, rest of the government) should be decided by votes, and not by an Imperial Decision of the Monarch."
ott.100.a:0 "Sultan will appoint the Grand Vizier"
ott.100.b:0 "The Government shall be formed by the Parliament"

ott.101.t:0 "Ottoman Constitution - Parliament schedule"
ott.101.d:0 "In the old constitution, Sultan had the rights to open, prorogue, and dissolve the parliament. As there had been a notorious occasion when Sultan Abdülhamid II abused his powers to prorogue the Parliament and not call another session for 30 years, many liberal members of the Sublime Committee are wary of allowing such powers again. What shall be the decision?"
ott.101.a:0 "Sultan opens and dissolves the parliament"
ott.101.b:0 "Parliament schedule is set by the Constitution"

ott.102.t:0 "Ottoman Constitution - Veto rights"
ott.102.d:0 "Another contentious issue was the veto rights of the Sultan. Monarchist and conservative members of the Committee insisted that Sultan, whom represents the collective will of the Ottoman Public, should have unchallenged veto powers, while liberal MP's pushed for the supremacy of the Parliament."
ott.102.a:0 "Sultan gets the last word."
ott.102.b:0 "A veto can be overturned by two-thirds majority"

ott.103.t:0 "Ottoman Constitution - Right to Petition"
ott.103.d:0 "Article 63 of the Constitution states that 'One or more persons of Ottoman nationality have the right of presenting petitions in the proper quarter relating to the breaking of law and regulation, and may likewise present in protest signed petitions to the General Ottoman Assembly, complaining of the conduct of state servants and functionaries.' \n\nWhile this article by itself seems sufficiently just, several members of the Sublime Committee suggested that minorities should be explicitly allowed to present petitions in local languages, as not stating this would allow a loophole where local governments could arbitrarily decide not to process petitions written in languages other than Turkish."
ott.103.a:0 "Allow petitions written in local languages"
ott.103.b:0 "If they want to complain, they should learn Turkish"

ott.104.t:0 "Ottoman Constitution - Rights of Trade Unions"
ott.104.d:0 "The issue of the rights of the trade unions and syndicates was a dreaded one, as both liberals and conseratives were wary of syndicalist factions gaining excessive powers. Three articles were composed after careful deliberation, aiming to give sufficient rights to the workers and limit syndicalist influence."
ott.104.a:0 "Allow all trade unions, strikes and lockouts"
ott.104.b:0 "Such godless syndicalism has no place in the Ottoman Empire!"

ott.105.t:0 "The New Constitution is declared!"
ott.105.d:0 "The new Ottoman Constitution was declared in the front garden of ancient Topkapı Palace today, with an accompanying ceremony and military parade. May our new 'Kanun-u Esasi' be auspicious!"
ott.105.a:0 "Long live the Sultan!"

ott.106.t:0 "Independence of the Judiciary"
ott.106.d:0 "Our chief legal experts argue that in the decision-making process, judges should have freedom to decide cases impartially, in accordance with their interpretation of the law and the facts; that they should be able to act without any restriction or improper influence. They claim that one of the most important standards underpinning the autonomy of the judiciary is irremovability, that is, for ordinary judges to be appointed permanently until retirement. Shall we give such guarantees of independence to our judges?"
ott.106.a:0 "We must ensure the independence of our Judiciary"
ott.106.b:0 "They shall have parliamentary oversight"
ott.106.c:0 "I am the law"

ott.107.t:0 "Centralisation or Decentralisation?"
ott.107.d:0 "While the Article 108 of the Ottoman Constitution declares that the vilayets shall be governed by the principle of 'decentralisation', this de jure principle has never transformed into action. Now that our sweeping administrative reforms are underway, the proponents of the doctrine of 'Adem-i Merkeziyet' are again asserting that subordinating local decision-making to the central bureaucracy results in tremendous inefficiency and pointless delays. With our distant subjects chafing under the direct rule of Kostantiniyye, it would be wise to give more power to local governments over our centrally-appointed governors. Shall we grant greater powers and freedoms to the administrative councils of our Vilayets?"
ott.107.a:0 "More power to the local governments!"
ott.107.b:0 "Frankly, I don't see the need for reform"

ott.108.t:0 "Indifference to New Laws"
ott.108.d:0 "Even though we made many changes to administrative law during the course of legal reforms, we are receiving numerous reports of regulators and bureaucrats completely disregarding the new laws, especially the ones concerning anti-corruption measures."
ott.108.a:0 "What is this insolence?!"

ott.109.t:0 "Interference in Courts!"
ott.109.d:0 "In former days, local administrators and military governors could freely interfere with legal proceedings, and sometimes even upturn court decisions. Such interference, coupled with corruption, quickly gave rise to injustice and public discontent. And although with our judicial reforms we aimed to prevent any such events from occuring again in the future, we are still receiving petitions from aggrieved peasants detailing high-level interference in courts of law."
ott.109.a:0 "Who dares interrupt justice?"

ott.110.t:0 "Ineffective Administration"
ott.110.d:0 "It has been several months since we formally adopted the metric system and the Standard Ottoman script, but we are still receiving troubling reports of incompetent bureaucrats being completely unable to use the new standards of measurement, while dozens of nearly-illiterate government officials have been discovered after they have proved incapable of deciphering the new form of official writing. It appears that the full implementation of these reforms will take more time than anticipated."
ott.110.a:0 "Who hired all these useless officials?!"

ott.111.t:0 "Corrupt Bureaucracy"
ott.111.d:0 "The notoriously widespread corruption in the Ottoman bureaucracy is a long-established phenomenon. Over the centuries, low wages and even lower moral standards of Ottoman government officials resulted in the gradual acceptance and normalisation of bribery as a means of income. Legitimised under terms such as 'hediye' and 'caize', corruption became so commonplace that several Ottoman sultans were recorded to have accepted bribes. Many efforts to curtail corruption were made over the centuries, none of them successful. Unfortunately, it seems that our coordinated efforts to end bribery are about to meet the same fate. The reforms we instituted, which include new laws and severe penalties, are being casually disregarded by the old-headed bureaucrats, almost all of whom are feeling quite secure in their entrenched positions in the government. Several reports we have received indicate that any action taken against these corrupt officials are quickly covered-up by complicit superiors and high officials. It appears that eliminating corruption will not be an easy task."

The Ottomans still administered the Sunni areas and maintained a sizeable garrison force. Following the conclusion of the Weltkrieg, Yemen was isolated from the rest of the empire.

In 1925, Mohammed Alim Khan of Bukhara visited Kostantiniyye to meet with Sultan Mehmed VI, and had a spectacular public fountain built in Eyüp, now known as 'Buhara Çeşmesi'. Cordial relations were maintained, but no further visits followed. Recently, as part of our diplomatic efforts to bring Turkic nations together, it was suggested that Sultan [Root.GetLeader] send a worthy gift to the Emir of Bukhara."

ott.173.d:0 "Our gendarmerie, with the aid of locals, has uncovered a network of syndicalist agents in Mosul who were allegedly arming and training militias to fight against our rule. In a series of raids 3 syndie agents were captured and important documents were discovered. It appears that Georgian and French Syndicalists are trying to organise an armed uprising in our Kurdish provinces."

ott.174.d:0 "In course of the ongoing operations against syndicalist interference in our Eastern provinces, a company-sized unit of our gendarmerie force was ambushed by Kurdish tribesmen near the Armenian border. Reinforcements from the army were quick to arrive on the scene, and the rebels were swiftly routed. While many of them managed to cross the border into Persia, our cavalry units managed to surround a small group of bandits who immediately surrendered. Among them were several Ottoman officers, including İhsan Nuri Bey. To everyone's surprise, a brief inquiry into the population records showed that these Ottoman-educated officers were not of Kurdish background, but instead had Armenian and Georgian ancestry. While it is not entirely clear why they were championing the cause of Kurdish separatism, it is evident that a wider conspiracy is at work..."

ott.175.t:0 "Druze revolt dispersed in Syria"
ott.175.d:0 "A large revolt of Druze tribesmen was recently crushed by our Desert Rangers. Hundreds of rebels have been killed, while the routed tribes returned to their villages and ceased their raids on our trade routes. Evidence shows that these revolts are being provoked by Hashemite agents."

ott.176.t:0 "Egyptian weapon shipments caught in Basra"
ott.176.d:0 "Thanks to an anonymous tip, two shipping containers full of rifles were discovered in Port Basra.

It appears that these weapons were destined for rebel groups in southern Iraq, to be used against our soldiers."
ott.176.a:0 "We will get to the bottom of this..."

ott.177.t:0 "Hashemite spies caught in Damascus"
ott.177.d:0 "Our gendarmerie, working together with local law enforcement, has managed to arrest several Hashemite spies in Damascus. Detailed maps of the region and intelligence notes on Ottoman military strength were found in the possession of these agents. Their mission seems to be the formation of clandestine cells across Syria, which would be activated in case of war between Arabian states and the Ottoman Empire."
ott.177.a:0 "Such scheming will not go unpunished..."

ott.178.t:0 "Victory Day!"
