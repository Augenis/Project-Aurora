Finally, in 1929, when German brought an end to the hostilities in Burma, the imposed treaty awarded the eastern part of Burma to Siam. In the last 20 years Siam peacefully increased its territory and became a stable and peaceful country. However, many think that the German Empire is in decline and Siam should not expect any more favours, but should start to build its defence in case the syndicalist or one of its neighbours (Burma and Yunnan above all) might try to conquer it."
