SAF_crisis:0 "Dealing with the Crisis"
SAF_crisis_desc:0 "The economic crisis threatens to tear the Union apart. We must reform our country's economy to solve mass unemployment, but the Volksraad stands divided on the path to take forwards. This choice will certainly have repercussions in the years to come, and may even exacerbate existing divides."
SAF_representation_of_natives:0 "Representation of the Natives"
SAF_representation_of_natives_tt:0 "Gets event '§YThe Representation of Natives Act of 1936§!'."
SAF_representation_of_natives_desc:0 "Originally planned before the current economic crisis took hold, the Representation of Natives Act of 1936 will become the centrepiece of upcoming social and political reforms within the country. The original provisions will probably have to be altered significantly, however."
SAF_protectorates:0 "Status of the Protectorates"
SAF_protectorates_desc:0 "The old HCTs are still mere protectorates within our sovereign territory. To develop them any further, we must integrate them into our country. This will however not be a simple task, and multiple paths are open to us. All of them are likely to lead to durable political unrest, however."
SAF_paramount_chiefs:0 "Extend Native Autonomy"
SAF_paramount_chiefs_desc:0 "Granting autonomy to the local rulers of the former HCTs would also us to install new, autonomous Paramount Chiefs of their respective ethnic groups (the Tswana in Bechuanaland, the Basotho in Basotuland and the Swazi in Swaziland) loyal to the central government."
SAF_personal_forces:0 "Personal Forces of the Paramount Chiefs"
SAF_personal_forces_desc:0 "Given the increased autonomy of the Paramount Chiefs, some of them are asking to be allowed to raise their own forces comprised of their respective tribesmen to better secure their own positions. While arming natives is an unpalatable prospect, it would reduce the strain upon the Union's armed forces."
SAF_askari:0 "Askari Corps for the Union"
SAF_askari_desc:0 "Now that we have armed certain ethnic groups, hawks in the Volksraad are suggesting that we may as well raise our own native units, ones that would be loyal not to the Paramount Chiefs but to the Union."
SAF_nuweveld:0 "Nuweveld Settlements"
SAF_nuweveld_desc:0 "Turning the newly annexed territories over to white settlers will encourage the establishment of new settlements throughout the Nuweveld and the cultural integration of the new regions. The locals however would lose access to most agricultural lands, forcing them to migrate to the cities for work as transient labour."
SAF_native_rights:0 "Native Rights"
SAF_native_rights_desc:0 "The integration of the Nuweveld territories and the desperate need to cheap labour in those regions has raised the issue of Native rights. Many politicians are now ready to make radical compromises in a few categories."
SAF_gesuiwerde_infrastructure:0 "The Kariba Dam"
SAF_gesuiwerde_infrastructure_desc:0 "Plans for a hydro-electric dam on the Zambezi have up until now been ruled out as prohibitively costly, but with access to plentiful local native labour, this massive project can now go ahead. We should start by reclaiming the land around the dam."

SAF_new_mines:0 "Industrial Mining"
SAF_new_mines_desc:0 "Industrialisation continues at an impressive pace with new mines are opening every month across the Orange Free State and the Transvaal. The roads of Johannesburg and Pretoria equal that of any European city. But there is discontent rising from the British provinces, who believe that our program is unfairly weighted towards the Afrikaans speaking areas."
SAF_complete_industrialisation:0 "The Afrikaner Recovery"
SAF_complete_industrialisation_desc:0 "We have finally solved our economical crisis and solidified our status as the most industrialised nation in Africa! The cost however has been severe, financially, politically and socially.

SAF_detente:0 "Détente"
SAF_detente_desc:0 "In an effort to bring our economy back from the crash brought on by German trade dependence, we have decided to look back towards the old empires for new trade opportunities. It is hoped that in so doing, British and French investment will create job opportunities for South Africa's unemployed."
SAF_new_docks:0 "Entente Harbour Investments"

SAF_kimberly_mines:0 "Kimberly Mines"
SAF_kimberly_mines_desc:0 "The influx of capital from the Entente continues to grow our economy. New mines have opened in Kimberly, but some members of the Gesuiwerde and even our own party have spoken out against the clear focus on British dominated parts of the country."
SAF_complete_detente:0 "The British Recovery"
SAF_complete_detente_desc:0 "We have finally solved our economic crisis and solidified our status as the most industrialised nation in Africa! However, the former Boer Republics seem to have been left behind.

SAF_extra_slot:0 "Fund the Cape Town University"
SAF_extra_slot_desc:0 "With the economy back on track, it is important to remember that scholarly pursuits are needed to maintain our position in Africa. Generous funding increases to the Cape Town University will allow us to educate the masses and become a beacon in a still dark continent."

While the vast majority of the population belong to the various native ethnic African groups, socio-economic power is held by the white European minority.

### Events ###

SAF.1.t:0 "The Black Monday hits South Africa"
SAF.1.d:0 "On the 3rd of February, the German stock market collapsed, plunging the world into depression. South Africa has relied on trade with Germany and its sphere of influence since the British Revolution and the declaration of the South African Republic and withdrawal from trade with the remaining members of the Entente. The crisis has had a terrible effect upon the South African economy, unemployment has risen markedly as many companies that depended upon the German export market went out of business or laid off white workers in favour of native labour."
SAF.1.a:0 "This is a disaster!"

SAF.2.t:0 "Dealing with the Crisis"
SAF.2.d:0 "The global economic crisis has hit South Africa hard. Our dependence on trade with Germany, long criticised by the pro-British Dominion Party, has seen deepening hardship take hold. However, the Volksraad is divided on how best to deal with the crisis. Cheap native labour is seen by many as the chief cause of unemployment and both the National Party and South African Labour Party are calling for further restrictions to be made upon native employment. The National Party also views that an ambitious works program and an exploitation of the Protectorates could alleviate the situation, while SA Labour feels that socio-economic reform is key to solving the crisis. The Dominion Party points again to the dependence on Germany and seeks a liberalisation of the economy and a resumption of ties with the Entente and the Empire, although large tracts of Afrikaner society would baulk at the mere prospect of such a heel turn after two decades of independence."
SAF.2.a:0 "The National Party will solve this crisis alone."
SAF.2.b:0 "Work with our old coalition partners, Labour."
SAF.2.c:0 "Co-operate with the Dominionists."

SAF.3.t:0 "The National Party Splits"
SAF.3.d:0 "Unwilling to compromise their values, the more extreme wing of the National Party led by Daniel François Malan has broken away to form the 'Gesuiwerde' or Purified National Party. They reject any compromise with either the British or the reds and believe that the best way to ensure the future of South Africa is to strengthen and expand the existing provincial segregation laws into a full nation-wide system, termed 'apartheid'."
SAF.3.a:0 "Oh dear!"

SAF.4.t:0 "The Union of South Africa"
SAF.4.d:0 "Formed in 1910 as a merger of the various British possessions in South Africa, the Cape Colony, Natal, Transvaal and the Orange Free State, the Union of South Africa is currently a parliamentary Republic, having seceded from the British Empire during the crisis of 1925. The British Revolution gave the anti-British coalition of the National and Labour Parties the opportunity to break free from British influence that they had been under since the end of the 2nd Boer War (1899-1902). The first President of South Africa, James Hertzog, used the chaos to annex the neighbouring British protectorates of South Rhodesia, Bechuanaland, Basotuland and Swaziland while leaving the remainder of Britain's African colonies to fall into the hands of the German Freistaat.\n\nSouth Africa's current constitution is an adaption of the 1909 South Africa Act. The Union of South Africa is an unitary state, rather than a federation, with each colony's parliaments abolished and replaced with provincial councils. The Parliament consists of two parts, the Volksraad and Senate. The Volksraad members are elected mostly by the country's white minority although the franchise varies depending upon the province, of which there are five: Cape, Natal, the Orange Free State, Transvaal and Rhodesia. In the Cape and Natal, a qualified franchise based upon property and education requirements is in place while the vote is white only in the remaining provinces. The Senate is appointed by an electoral college consisting of members of each of the five Provincial Councils and members of the Volksraad. The Government follows the Westminster model, although with an elected President as head of state. South Africa continues to administer Bechuanaland, Basotuland and Swaziland as protectorates and while considerable legislation is in place restricting the rights of the native population within the Union, it has not been fully implemented in these territories."
SAF.4.a:0 "Union is Strength"

SAF.5.t:0 "The Representation of Natives Act of 1936"
SAF.5.d:0 "Originally planned before the current economic crisis took hold, the Representation of Natives Act is meant to further solidify white political control in South Africa by repealing the Cape Qualified Franchise and its similar counterpart in Natal that allows a small section of the native population to take part in elections. This would be done by taking natives out of the electoral rolls completely, with chiefs, local councils, urban advisory boards and election committees in all five provinces electing five whites to the Senate by a system of block voting.\n\nHowever, in this new political climate the Gesuiwerde National Party are advising we use this opportunity to appease our core electoral support, the Afrikaners, by attacking part the Dominionists' electorate by proscribing Coloureds as well as natives from voting. Such a move would draw the ire of the other sections of South African society and is something we are perhaps not ready for just yet. There is also the question of whether to establish a Native Representative Council, a move denounced by liberals who view it as an attempt to not just disenfranchise the natives but to separate them politically from our national polity."
SAF.5.a:0 "Establish the Native Representative Council!"
SAF.5.b:0 "Pass the original text."
SAF.5.c:0 "Coloureds will also be barred from elections!"

SAF.6.d:0 "Originally planned before the current economic crisis took hold, the Representation of Natives Act is meant to further solidify white political control in South Africa by repealing the Cape Qualified Franchise and its similar counterpart in Natal that allows a small section of the native population to take part in elections. This would be done by taking natives out of the electoral rolls completely, with chiefs, local councils, urban advisory boards and election committees in all five provinces electing five whites to the Senate by a system of block voting.\n\nHowever, due to our coalition with the Dominionists, their Progressive wing are advising we expand the number of allotted representatives in the Senate from five to ten and to be allowed to elect an equal number to sit in the Volksraad. Afrikaner nationalists in our party are vehemently against such moderating measures and we fear many will leave for Malan's breakaway GNP. We could however, always fall back on the promise of a Native Representative Council to balance the desires of both factions."
SAF.6.b:0 "Amend the original text."
SAF.6.c:0 "The coalition falls apart!"

SAF.7.t:0 "The Gesuiwerde Rejoin the Government"
SAF.7.d:0 "Malan's Gesuiwerde have returned, following the breakup of our coalition with Smut's Dominionists. The Gesuiwerde are now strongly pushing their proposals to attack the British position in the Cape by restricting the Coloured vote as well. The situation is volatile, but it is a move that will be welcomed by our core support."
SAF.7.a:0 "Just establish the Native Representative Council!"
SAF.7.b:0 "Concede to the Gesuiwerde!"

SAF.8.t:0 "The Status of the Protectorates"
SAF.8.d:0 "Now that we have dealt with the issue of natives within our traditional borders, we should address the status of the former British protectorates of Bechuanaland, Basotuland and Swaziland. While South Rhodesia was integrated as the fifth province of our Union because of its white population, the protectorates (High Commission Territories as they were referred to under British control) were kept as they were before 1925 and governed by South African Commissioners in conjunction with local rulers. Yet as time has moved on, pressure has grown demanding their full incorporation into South Africa, mainly by Afrikaner nationalists who view the territory as 'Nuweveld', cheap land for Afrikaner farmers to claim. Dominionists however want their incorporation but with control still in the hands of local rulers who would be elevated to the status of Paramount Chiefs of their respective ethnic groups."
SAF.8.a:0 "Grant power to the new Paramount Chiefs."
SAF.8.b:0 "They shall become the Nuweveld!"

SAF.9.t:0 "The National Recovery Plan"
SAF.9.d:0 "We must now move to resolve the economic crisis plaguing our nation. The majority of the party is in support of a general work program for the unemployed, the idea being that this will get our economy back on its feet again and have a rapid impact on the issues most resented by the people. The Gesuiwerde are pushing for increased industrialisation, but while the long term benefits would be immense, the cost at this stage could be prohibitive. The Dominionists, meanwhile, are suggesting a liberalization of the economy and redirecting our trade to the British and the Entente at large, they may be right in their attempts to tackle this crisis, but it would certainly be very unpopular outside the Cape and Natal."
SAF.9.a:0 "Create jobs for the unemployed!"
SAF.9.b:0 "We must industrialise!"
SAF.9.c:0 "Liberalise the economy!"

SAF.10.t:0 "The Extent of Native Autonomy"
SAF.10.d:0 "The increased autonomy of the former HCT provinces, under the leadership of the new Paramount Chiefs (the Tswana in Bechuanaland, the Basotho in Basotuland amd the Swazi in Swaziland), has seen increased economic opportunity for Africans. However, we need to clarify the extent of the power of the Chiefs. Local autonomy would be widely accepted but would also limit the potential of this decentralisation effort. Expanding it to the entire Union, however, would allow us to unlock the true potential of the Native population, with the risk of seriously upsetting the Boer populations."
SAF.10.a:0 "Their authority stops at the border."
SAF.10.b:0 "They will fully represent their people."

SAF.11.t:0 "Native Rights"
SAF.11.d:0 "Our recent integration efforts of the Nuweveld and the economical crisis has brought the question of Native rights to the forefront of the current political debate. The Dominionists have made their position clear, and ask of us to not make any compromise on the Natives' rights. The Moderates recommend that we take a more tactful approach to the situation, only stripping non-essential rights to facilitate exploitation of their populations. The Gesuiwerde, meanwhile, has proposed to simply put the Natives to forced labour, an explosive but straightforward proposal."
SAF.11.a:0 "We will not compromise on Native rights."
SAF.11.b:0 "Suspend some Native rights."
SAF.11.c:0 "Send the Natives to forced labour."

### SACW Events ###
SACW.1.t:0 "The Port Elizabeth Deceleration"
SACW.1.d:0 "Today in Port Elizabeth the leading figures of the Dominion Party, General Jan C Smuts and Jan Hofmeyer, along with the provincial governors of the Cape, Natal and Rhodesia met to discuss the coming election in May. An agreement has been reached now that support for the Dominion Party and dissatisfaction with the ruling Nationalist govt has reached the point where the pro British faction could form the next administration. To that end, they have issued a deceleration, stating their intent to reform the Union of South Africa into a new more liberal Federation and to pursue a reconciliation with the British Empire."
SACW.1.a:0 "Hmmm..."

SACW.2.t:0 "The 1938 Union of South Africa Election"
SACW.2.d:0 "The 1938 Union of South Africa General Election has transformed into a referendum on the country's future. Either the Nationalists will retain control of the Volksraad and set about solidifying white - Afrikaner rule through a full system of Apartheid or they will be defeated by the Dominion Party who will move to enact the Port Elizabeth Deceleration and the formation of a new federal South Africa. In what is likely to become the most important election in the nations history, tensions are running high as reports of violent incidents throughout the country increase with each passing day."
SACW.2.a:0 "The National Party"
SACW.2.b:0 "The Dominion Party"

SACW.3.t:0 "The Nationalist Government"
SACW.3.d:0 "The National Party has seen off the challenge by Smut's Dominionists. However, the election was dangerously close, the Nationalists only having a razor thin majority in the Volksraad. One of the more noticable feature was that all of the representatives for natives were Dominionists and the Coloured vote was overwhelmingly pro British. The hawks are saying we should move immediately to severe the political ties between the races in the Union of South Africa once and for all by finally bringing into existence Apartheid. The atmosphere is dangerous though and any rash moves could well be met by resistance."
SACW.3.a:0 "Begin the process of Apartheid!"
SACW.3.b:0 "Now is not the time..."

SACW.4.t:0 "The Dominionist Government"
SACW.4.d:0 "The Dominion Party has finally defeated the pro Afrikaner Nationalist Party and gained control of the Volksraad. However, the election was dangerously close, the Dominionist majority being razor thin. While gains were limited in Afrikaner dominated areas, native and coloured voters have overwhelmingly endorsed our proposed federal model. Should we push ahead and declare the end of the old Union and the start of the new South African Federation? Or should we wait until the climate is less hostile, as any rash move now could be met with resistance."
SACW.4.a:0 "Declare the start of a new Federation!"
SACW.4.b:0 "Implement change gradually..."

SACW.5.t:0 "Construction of the Voortrekker Monument"
SACW.5.d:0 "Begun in 1935, construction of the Voortrekker Monument is nearing completion. Situated in Pretoria, it commemorates the Voortrekkers who left the Cape Colony between 1835 and 1854 to found the Afrikaner republics of the interior. Costs however continue to grow, but we are on scheduale to open the Monument at the Centenary celebrations next year."
SACW.5.a:0 "It will be a lasting legacy!"

SACW.6.t:0 "Preperations for the Centenary Celebrations"
SACW.6.d:0 "The Centenial Anniversary of the Great Trek is little under a month away. The centenary celebrations are planned to commence with a re-enactment of the trek beginning on 8 August 1938 with nine ox wagons at the statue of Jan van Riebeeck in Cape Town and end at the newly completed Voortrekker Monument in Pretoria, at which time the Monument shall be inaugurated by the President. The whole affair is meant to be a celebration of Afrikaner culture and heritage, but the situation in the country has changed, and such a lavish event could very well be met with open hostility by the other racial groups who are likely to see it as a display of triumphalism. Shall we continue as planned or adopt a more modest approach?"
SACW.6.a:0 "It will go ahead as planned!"
SACW.6.b:0 "Perhaps a more modest approach is best..."

SACW.7.t:0 "100th Anniversary of the Great Trek"
SACW.7.d:0 "One hundred years ago today, our ancestors set out from the Cape, seeking life land and liberty free from British domination. While the ceremony proceeded without incident, the atmosphere was of a subdued nature in Cape Town as the reenactment departed."
SACW.7.a:0 "Could have been worse..."

SACW.8.t:0 "Inauguration of the Voortrekker Monument"
SACW.8.d:0 "The reenactment of the Great Trek that left Cape Town 2 weeks ago has arrived in Pretoria. President Hertzog addressed the crowd, saying that unity was needed in these troubled times to preserve the Union of South Africa. The ceremony was a more reserved affair than many had expected, but the lack of any hostilities in response was a welcome relief for the government."
SACW.8.a:0 "Hurrah!"

SACW.9.t:0 "100th Anniversary of the Great Trek"
SACW.9.d:0 "One hundred years ago today, our ancestors set out from the Cape, seeking life land and liberty free from British domination. Unfortunately large numbers of British and Coloureds attended the ceremony in protest, with attempts being made to impede the procession until police cleared a path. However one of the wagons was destroyed and several of the participants injured."
SACW.9.a:0 "Oh Dear!"

SACW.10.t:0 "The Cape Town Riots"
SACW.10.d:0 "The Voortrek protests have grown and got out of hand as Cape Town has descended into chaos. Riots sweep the city, targeting symbols of Afrikaner history and culture, such as the statue of Jan van Riebeeck, which has been torn down. The police and army units stationed nearbye are doing very little in the way of preventing these outrages."
SACW.10.a:0 "Outrageous!"

SACW.11.t:0 "ISL Mineworkers Strike"
SACW.11.d:0 "The Syndicalist ISL has encouraged the mine workers of the Orange Free State to go on strike. Attempts to break the strike were met with resistance, with deaths on both sides. The industrial unrest looks set to spread into the Traansval as well now."
SACW.11.a:0 "Red bastards!"

SACW.12.t:0 "Inauguration of the Voortrekker Monument"
SACW.12.d:0 "The reenactment of the Great Trek that left Cape Town 2 weeks ago has finally arrived in Pretoria. President Hertzog addressed the crowd, saying that the Afrikaner nation must stand together to preserve its way of life and that he would never surrender the Union of South Africa to either the Briton or the native. The ceremony was an extravagant affair, with tens of thousands attending. Pretoria and Johannesburg have been gripped in a nationalist frenzy, with incidents of violence being committed against British and native residents."
SACW.12.a:0 "We are proud Afrikaners!"

SACW.13.t:0 "The Natal Covenant"
SACW.13.d:0 "In resonse to Hertzog's speech in Pretoria, today in Durban City Hall the provincial governor and council have declared their secession from the Union of South Africa. The have drawn up a document refferred to as 'the Natal Covenant' which states that they are loyal supporters of the British Empire and as such will never support our republic. Thousands of Natalians have signed the document and the governors and councils of Rhodesia and the Cape have declared their support of it as well."
SACW.13.a:0 "If it's a fight they want..."

SACW.14.t:0 "The End of the Union?"
SACW.14.d:0 "Now that fully three of the five provinces of the Union of South Africa are in open revolt, there are calls for us to renounce the fraying mantle of the Union, itself an imperialist anachronism. Instead they advise we should restore the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek, but perhaps that is a step too far?"
SACW.14.a:0 "No we will preserve the Union!"
SACW.14.b:0 "Restore the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek!"

SACW.15.t:0 "Preperations for the Centenary Celebrations"
SACW.15.d:0 "The Centenial Anniversary of the Great Trek is little under a month away.

The whole affair was meant to be a celebration of Afrikaner culture and heritage, but the situation in the country has changed, we could allow it to proceed as planned or we could reign in the scale of the events so as not to be seen as pandering to the Afrikaners."
SACW.15.a:0 "It will go ahead as planned!"

SACW.17.t:0 "Innauguration of the Voortrekker Monument"
SACW.17.d:0 "The reenactment of the Great Trek that left Cape Town 2 weeks ago has arrived in Pretoria. President Smuts addressed the crowd, saying that unity was needed and that the rights of the Afrikaner community would be respected as we move forwards to federalism. The ceremony was a success, despite protests by the Afrikaner Broederbond and other nationalist groups."
SACW.17.a:0 "Hurrah!"

SACW.18.t:0 "100th Anniversary of the Great Trek"
SACW.18.d:0 "One hundred years ago today, our ancestors set out from the Cape, seeking life land and liberty free from British domination. The ceremony was lacklustre, the poor funding evident. This was offset however by the large turnout of Afrikaners from other parts of South Africa to take part, including a group calling themselves the Ossewabrandwag (Ox-Wagon Sentinels). Unfortunately this militia of sorts clashed with local police who struggled to handle the larger than expected turnout. With violence escalting the police tried to bring the procession and disperse the reenactors which resulted in shots being exchanged, killing 3 policemen and 17 Ossewabrandwag with many more reenactors and bystanders injured."
SACW.18.a:0 "Oh Dear!"

SACW.19.t:0 "The Ossewabrandwag Riots"
SACW.19.d:0 "Throughout the former Boer Republics branches of the Ossewabrandwag have formed and have begun to organise protests against our government, many of them descending into rioting. The Afrikaner nationalists target natives and Britons alike as they view these groups as collaborating against them to destroy Afrikaner culture. Police and military units stationed nearbye have been reluctant to intervene and have done little to end the violence."
SACW.19.a:0 "Outrageous!"

SACW.20.t:0 "ISL Mineworkers Strike"
SACW.20.d:0 "The Syndicalist ISL has encouraged the mine workers of the Orange Free State to go on strike in response to the OssewaBrandwag attacks.

SACW.21.d:0 "The reenactment of the Great Trek that left Cape Town 2 weeks ago has finally arrived in Pretoria. President Smuts was unable to attend as it constituted a security risk. Instead, ex-president Hertzog addressed the crowd, saying that the Afrikaner nation must stand together to preserve its way of life and that he would never surrender the Union of South Africa to either the Briton or the native. The ceremony was an much expanded affair due to OssewaBrandwag contributions, with tens of thousands attending. Pretoria and Johannesburg have been gripped in a nationalist frenzy, with incidents of violence being committed against British and native residents."
SACW.21.a:0 "We are proud Afrikaners!"

SACW.22.t:0 "Restoration of the Z.A.R."
SACW.22.d:0 "The provincial governors of both the Transvaal and the Orange Free State have declared their secession from the Union of South Africa and have formed together the 2nd Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek and named Hertzog their President.

SACW.25.t:0 "The Nationalist Coup"
SACW.25.d:0 "Forces loyal to the ex president Hertzog, have launched a coup with the aim of seizing control of the country and reversing our attempts at federalisation. While successful in the Orange Free State and the Transvaal, where they met little resistance and were joined by local military units - elesewhere they made sparse progress. In Cape Town, militants of the Ossewabrandwag tried to occupy the Parliament but were repulsed by the guards stationed there and a rapidly formed militia which drove them from the city. The provincial governors of both the Transvaal and the Orange Free State have declared their secession from the South African Federation and have formed together the 2nd Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek and named Hertzog their president."

We could send supplies and volunteers to the Afrikaners, or we could get ivolved in the conflict ourselves, dispatching an expeditionary force that is being provisionally called 'Der Kronenkranich Legion' (the Crowned Cran Legion), after the famed bird of Tanganyika.
