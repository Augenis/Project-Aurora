 GER_doctrine_mobile:0 "Motorised Divisions"
 GER_doctrine_mobile_desc:0 "While a machine-gun nest and a trench is almost impassable to infantry, panzers have shown that modern war need not be stale and immobile. While we should lean back on a large infantry army, armored fists should be utilised to tear enemy lines apart."
 GER_doctrine_mobile_2:0 "Mobility School"
 GER_doctrine_mobile_2_desc:0 "Swift manoeuvres, encircling and cutting off pockets of resistance is the way of the future.

 GER_security:0 "Status of the FAUD"
 GER_security_desc:0 "The FAUD have for a long time been a thorn in the side of German Society, promoting syndicalist ideals to the common man.

 GER_black_monday_desc:0 "The great crash of 1936, widely known as the 'Black Monday' has had a massive impact on German politics, culture, and society. While the damage might never be fixed, we should enact reforms and recovery policies to regain some of our lost capacity."
 GER_mil_industry_1:0 "The Wilhelm Groener Plan - Initiation"
 GER_mil_industry_1_desc:0 "There are few men in the German Empire who understands military matters and logistics as well as Wilhelm Groener. The highly decorated former general has suggested a plan for relativizing the economy by invested in our military industry. He claims that to get the economy running, people need to get work. What better place than in the military industrial complex, governed by the state?" 
 GER_mil_industry_2:0 "The Wilhelm Groener Plan - Progression"
 GER_mil_industry_2_desc:0 "While we have some part of the way, Groener claims that more can, and must be, done.

 GER_civ_industry_3_desc:0 "With our civilian industry once again strong, but not yet booming, we are required to take just a few more steps.

### Domestic Events

gerdom.1.t:0 "The Constitution of the German Reich"
gerdom.1.d:0 "After the crushing defeat of the Second French Empire by forces of the North German Federation, our constitution was signed in 1871 by representatives of the North German Federation and of four Southern German states. This constitution put the Southern German states under the influence of the North German Federation, thus giving the enlarged entity a new identity as the Deutsches Reich. \n\nAccording to the constitution, the empire was a federation of 25 German states. The Bundespräsidium was held by the King of Prussia, who had the title of German Emperor. The Emperor appointed the Chancellor, the head of government and chairman of the Bundesrat, the council of representatives of the German states. Laws were enacted by the Bundesrat and the Reichstag, the Imperial Diet elected by male Germans above the age of 25 years. \n\nHowever, it is the Emperor, not the Bundesrat or the Reichstag, who leads the power in the German Empire. With an option to dissolve the Reichstag on a whim, it is clear that the main political power in the German Empire rests not in Reichstag, elected by the people, but in the hands of the non-elected German Emperor. Another issue is the Prussian three-class voting system, which has remained unchanged since 1849. \n\nOver sixty years after the founding of the Kaiserreich, the liberals and social democrats are growing increasingly disgruntled with this status of things and our constitution may see large revisions in the next few years..."
gerdom.1.a:0 "A constitution guarantees stability, at least."

gerdom.2.t:0 "Hans von Seeckt dies"
gerdom.2.d:0 "Our Chief of General Staff, Hans von Seeckt, has died today in Berlin. The hero of the Intervention in China passed away peacefully in his sleep. Our nation is mourning the loss of a true German hero."
gerdom.2.a:0 "A state funeral is least we can do!"

gerdom.3.t:0 "A State Funeral for a war hero"
gerdom.3.d:0 "A state funeral has been given for Hans von Seeckt. All-important dignitaries were in attendance. Afterward, the Chief of the Army, August von Mackensen, could be seen whispering something to the Kaiser."
gerdom.3.a:0 "I wonder what von Mackensen is up to?"

gerdom.4.t:0 "August von Mackensen retires"
gerdom.4.d:0 "August von Mackensen has delivered his official retirement message to the Kaiser, wearing his trademark Life Hussar uniform. The Field Marshal is already eighty-six years old, and wishes merely to live out his days in peace. The Kaiser accepted the resignation, and ordered a celebration in his honour."
gerdom.4.a:0 "This might be the time to reform our military."

gerdom.5.t:0 "Reorganisation of the Army"
gerdom.5.d:0 "With new doctrines calling for a mobile tank force, Germany has begun to form dedicated tank divisions to break through enemy lines. The Army is looking with favour on the new equipment."
gerdom.5.a:0 "Create the Panzer Divisions!"

gerdom.6.t:0 "The Backlash within the Army"
gerdom.6.d:0 "The Kaiser's controversial decision has caused waves within the General Staff and War Ministry. There is great displeasure within the powerful High Command of the Army for the decision and many threaten resignation!"
gerdom.6.a:0 "It is of natural consequence..."

gerdom.7.t:0 "The Status of Ceylon"
gerdom.7.d:0 "With our economy having declined greatly after Black Monday, our Colonial Empire has been under fairly harsh scrutiny. Another part of our colonial empire that has been put under harsh scrutiny from various commissions is Ceylon. They are complaining that upkeep is too high since this island is of only little use to the German Empire. To help with our deficit it has been proposed that we grant natives autonomy or sell island to Princely Federation. What shall we do?"
gerdom.7.a:0 "Keep Ceylon under our control"
gerdom.7.b:0 "Grant natives autonomous status within German Empire"
gerdom.7.c:0 "Offer Ceylon to the Princely Federation"

gerdom.8.t:0 "The Sale of Ceylon"
gerdom.8.d:0 "The Germans have come to us offering us the sale of Ceylon. While it would obviously cost us a sizeable amount of money, having the island once more would greatly strengthen our position in Indian Ocean. What shall our reply be?"

gerdom.8.b:0 "We do not need that rock"

gerdom.9.t:0 "The Sale of Ceylon"
gerdom.9.d:0 "Ambassador of the Princely Federation has sent a message to us declaring that government has agreed to buy Ceylon. We have begun to transfer control over island to them."
gerdom.9.a:0 "Great"

gerdom.10.t:0 "The Princely Federation refused our offer"
gerdom.10.d:0 "The Princely Federation has replied to our offer flatly stating that they do not want Ceylon. We can now only keep things as they are or allow natives more autonomy. What shall we do?" 

gerdom.11.t:0 "Agricultural Crisis in Mitteleuropa"
gerdom.11.d:0 "During this time of great crisis, the agricultural sector of German economy is one of the most vulnerable to turmoil. With this in mind, several Junkers, representing the landed nobility of the Kingdom of Prussia, have asked for protectionist legislation and subsidies to their production. By imposing tariffs on foreign produce, we will strengthen this important sector of the Reich's economy. Such a measure is likely to cause further damage to the economy of our neighbours, however, as they are greatly dependant in trade with Germany. The wheat crops in the Ukraine are particularly vulnerable."
gerdom.11.a:0 "We must protect our own peasants."
gerdom.11.b:0 "We must uphold our foreign obligations."

gerdom.12.t:0 "The increasing activity of the suffragist movement"
gerdom.12.d:0 "Lately there has been a rise in activity of the supporters of women's suffrage, that is those who want to grant women the right to vote and to run for office. In this troubled times for the German Empire, it is not easy to choose the best solution. Granting them what they ask would anger the more conservative elements of our government, especially the members of the Reichstag (currently elected by universal male suffrage). On the other hand, a stern refusal followed by reprisals may lead to riots and more protests, especially in the more liberal states (that already permitted female voting in regional assemblies). The third possibility is a compromise: granting women the right to vote and be elected in the local assemblies of all the constituent members of the Empire. But this last solution might only postpone the problem for the present time and we might have to deal with these suffragists again in the near future."
gerdom.12.a:0 "Grant universal voting rights for all women!"
gerdom.12.b:0 "Grant women voting rights in all local assemblies!"
gerdom.12.c:0 "Refuse such preposterous demands!"

gerdom.13.t:0 "German women demand recognition for their war effort"
gerdom.13.d:0 "In the great war against the French syndicalist, German women have proven their loyalty and support for the Empire. Some of them proved fundamental for our propaganda efforts and many of them started working in factories to relieve the men that had to leave and fight the enemy at the front. Their contribution has been invaluable and they have proven their ability and independence. For these reason, the suffragist movement is stronger than ever and asking once again the government to grant women the right to vote and to run for office."
gerdom.13.a:0 "Grant universal voting rights for all women!"
gerdom.13.b:0 "They shall have voting rights in all local assemblies!"
gerdom.13.c:0 "What is this syndicalist nonsense? Arrest them all!"

gerdom.14.t:0 "Halbstarke terrorise the cities"
gerdom.14.d:0 "With the devastating economic situation, many families struggle to earn their daily bread and the social security net is strained beyond the breaking point. Now in the last weeks, the streets of many German cities have been increasingly terrorised by gangs of teenagers. These 'Halbstarke' steal products from the markets and shops, and often money from innocent pedestrians, or commit acts of vandalism, to escape boredom and frustration. More and more citizens do not feel safe anymore on the streets."
gerdom.14.a:0 "Mein Gott! Shocking!"

gerdom.15.t:0 "Organise the Youth"
gerdom.15.d:0 "Some experts have suggested that the best solution against the current lawlessness displayed by parts of our nation's youth is to organise them into youth organisations, so that they can learn new skills and use their energies for the public good. The Pfadfinder organisation would require increased spending for such an endeavour."
gerdom.15.a:0 "This won't be necessary"
gerdom.15.b:0 "Provide the funding"

 gerdom.16.t:0 "Commission the SMS Tirpitz"
 gerdom.16.d:0 "A new warship is now available to join our High Seas Fleet. This vessel will do much to improve our security and allow us to better project our influence and good will across the globe."

However, the army is not Germany! And under the African Skies our loyal colonies remain committed to the war-effort. But the government is facing suspicions for presiding over the greatest military catastrophe to ever occur to Germany and army officers are demanding a new emergency chancellor to be appointed. Many of them are clamoring for Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck to be elevated to this position, given his successes in the Weltkrieg and the loyalty and affection he commands among the askaris."

Controversially, von Lettow-Vorbeck also proposes that we present the leaders of the various sub-states of Mittelafrika with the prospect of complete independence as a reward for their services to the Imperial dynasty and its government.

gerdom.104.d:0 "The French-speaking minority in our western border regions was always considered as liability, since their loyalty to our state was always in question. This is considered true especially now, with the increasingly belligerent Commune of France rising from her ashes on our western borders.

In order to fully secure our territorial integrity, part of right wing political circles demand complete dissolution of all French or French funded organisations.

gerdom.101.d:0 "Right-wing circles have been calling for a crusade against Commune of France ever since communards managed to oust legal French government from mainland France. Now their wishes have finally come true, as state of war exist between our glorious Vaterland and the nest of syndicalist vipers.

gerdom.102.d:0 "A month before the elections, yet another scandal was revealed by the media. Die Gartenlaube, one of the newspapers owned by the DVLP chairman Alfred Hugenberg, reported that two daughters of Freiherr Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord, general and friend of influential Reichskriegsminister von Schleicher, were involved in shady dealings with syndicalist intelligence. Shortly afterwards, the Reichstag member Franz Seldte fanned the flames by asking why the Abwehr, run by von Schleicher's friend Ferdinand von Bredow, was not able to find out that the family of an associate of the state secretary on war was infiltrated by hostile intelligence. While general von Hammerstein-Equord resigned and publicly apologised for his daughter’s doings, the real question for von Schleicher was - should he pull strings to replace von Bredow and remove any further threats to his political career from that direction, and if yes - by whom?"
gerdom.102.a:0 "Irren ist menschlich!"

Despite critics saying that since the beginning of these auditions chancellor prefers to spend time in broadcasting company's headquarters rather than in Reichstag, the broadcast proved to be a great success."

Originally a holiday to honour the Prussian military, the Sedantag transformed into celebrating the foundation of the Reich, and after the Weltkrieg the defeat of those forces that tried to destroy it. \n\nThroughhout every town and village from Aachen to Memel, every street is decorated in black, white, and red. Every bell proudly proclaims this day of celebration. Nobility, soldiers and unnumbered veterans parade proudly through the streets, cheered by the happy masses. Indeed, this is a good day, a day that reminds us of the peace and prosperity we have enjoyed since the forging of the Reich."
gerflavour.1.a:0 "Heil dem Kaiserreich!"

gerflavour.2.d:0 "Luise Hoffmann was the first German woman to gain a pilot's license. After her 1933 transatlantic solo flight she has become one of Germany's most famous aviation pioneers, along heroes like Manfred von Richthofen and Gunther Pluschow. Today, Fraulein Hoffmann has acomplished a new long distance record in her customized Fokker F-IX. Starting in Tahiti 36 hours ago, Fraulein Hoffmann today landed savely in Lae on German New Guinea, where she was welcomed by a jubilous crowd and governor Albert Hahl. \n\nIt has been rumored that Hoffmann will soon attempt a solo flight around the world. This would place her at a direct competition with the Red Baron who is planning a similar endeavour..."

gerflavour.3.d:0 "An exciting day for the history of aviation. Manfred von Richthofen has accepted Luise Hoffmann's challenge.

gerflavour.6.t:0 "Erich von Ludendorff dies"
gerflavour.6.d:0 "Even after his death was reported early this morning, Erich von Ludendorff remains one of the most controversial persons in recent German history. On one hand he was a hero of the Weltkrieg, the orchestrator of German victory in 1919. On the other hand, most Germans haven't forgotten his ensuing military dictatorship, that only ended when Admiral Von Tirpitz forced him to retire after the infamous Osthilfeskandal in 1924. Although Ludendorff still recieved some honours for his service, like his knighthood, the former quartermaster-general mostly led a secluded life at his estate afterwards."
gerflavour.6.a:0 "Let's remember the genius, not the dictator."

gerflavour.7.t:0 "Georg Michaelis dies"
gerflavour.7.d:0 "The former Reichskanzler Georg Michaelis died today at the age of 78. Succeeding von Bethmann-Hollweg as Imperial Chancellor in 1917, the first and until now the only commoner to have acceeded to the post of German chancellor, he was considered by many as the stooge of the Hindenburg-Ludendorff dictatorship, being forced to resign and replaced by Hindenburg after Ludendorff grew dissatisfied with him in 1919. As a former Reichskanzler, he received a state funeral, but the Kaiser refused to attend."
gerflavour.7.a:0 "He was a commoner and a stooge, but a Chancellor after all."
 
gerflavour.8.t:0 "Tenth anniversary of von Tirpitz' death"
gerflavour.8.d:0 "Today is the tenth anniversary of the death of the Great Chancellor and Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz. As the eight Chancellor and Commander of the German Navy Tirpitz led the Kaiserreich out of the Ludendorff dicatorship, initiating the Golden Age that lasted through the Twenties until his death. \n\nAfter his death, his Deutsche Vaterlandspartei (German Fatherland party, DVLP), reformed into the Junker party it is today under their new leader, Alfred Hugenberg, opening the way for the von Papen's Deutschkonservative Partei (German Conservative Party, DKP). And while the Reich enjoyed prosperity under his reign, he also continued o hold off on fulfilling the Kaiser's Easter Promises from 1917, leaving us with some troubles in the past years. \n\nStill, his prestige is enourmous, and the anniversary of his death has been accompanied by public demonstrations of respect all across the Empire."
