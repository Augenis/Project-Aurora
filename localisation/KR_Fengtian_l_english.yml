### New Opinion Modifiers ###
FNG_MANTETSU_COLLAB:0 "Mantetsu Collaboration"

### Foci ###
FNG_Preservation_of_the_Xinhai_Order:0 "Preservation of the Xinhai Order"
FNG_Preservation_of_the_Xinhai_Order_desc:0 "Ironically, Fengtian is the sole national government upholding the order established by the Xinhai Revolution in 1911, which called for the overthrow of the Qing and the establishment of a Republic. Although its republican commitments are questionable, and Southern reclamation is currently unrealistic, the government has loudly advocated both goals, as they foster domestic legitimacy."
FNG_Fuguo_Qiangbing:0 "Fuguo Qiangbing"
FNG_Fuguo_Qiangbing_desc:0 "Translating roughly to 'Enrich the Nation, Strengthen the Army', this proverb dates back to pre-Han legalist philosophers, but has been used more recently to inspire reforms in both Guangxu Era China and Meiji Era Japan. Now it is applied again in Fengtian, as the government seeks to modernise and eventually strike South against the resurgent Qing Dynasty, and from there establish control over all China."
#Enrich the Nation Branch
FNG_Enrich_the_Nation:0 "Enrich the Nation"
FNG_Enrich_the_Nation_desc:0 "Manchuria's strength lies in its bountiful natural resources, characterised by Japanese publications as a 'boundless cornucopia', and its deposits of strategic resources like coal and iron have been designated as of "world-class significance". With a little Japanese help, Fengtian can forge for itself both a prosperous future and a mighty war-machine!"
#Mantetsu Collaboration Section
FNG_Mantetsu_Collaboration:0 "Mantetsu Collaboration"
FNG_Mantetsu_Collaboration_desc:0 "Mantetsu, also known as the 'South Manchuria Railway Company', exerts an enormous amount of control over our economy, with numerous subsidiaries ranging from flour mills to hospitals. It will unfortunately be essential to developing most aspects of our economy that require Japanese technical expertise."
FNG_Yamato_Hotel_Licenses:0 "Yamato Hotel Licenses"
FNG_Yamato_Hotel_Licenses_desc:0 "One of Mantetsu's most successful ventures in Manchuria is its Yamato Hotel franchise, which serves the countless Japanese businessmen who make their way to and from the Home Islands every day. Despite the unwelcome influence they bear, their skills and capital are crucial."
FNG_The_Soy_Agricultural_Initiative:0 "The Soy Agricultural Initiative"
FNG_The_Soy_Agricultural_Initiative_desc:0 "Fengtian's significant Korean minority are skilled rice planters, but soybeans have become an extremely desirable cash crop, as they provide not only an excellent source of food, fertiliser, and animal feed, but also soy oil with industrial applications. Mantetsu undertook an effort to educate Koreans in Soy farming, but the response has been mixed. They now want our help to push this through."
FNG_Japanese_Electrical_Expertise:0 "Japanese Electrical Expertise"
FNG_Japanese_Electrical_Expertise_desc:0 "Thanks to China's backwardness over the past century, and the chaos of the past two decades, the country has few native engineers. Japanese assistance will be essential in bringing modernity to Manchuria."
FNG_Mantetsu_Research_Wing:0 "Mantetsu Research Wing"
FNG_Mantetsu_Research_Wing_desc:0 "Mantetsu's Research Wing, known as 'Mantetsu Chosabu', serves as the centrepiece of Japan's colonial program, and pursues a wide variety of scientific goals. Its massive funding and talent pool could be of great use to us in our own efforts."
FNG_Mantetsu_Civil_Engineering_Projects:0 "Mantetsu Civil Engineering Projects"
FNG_Mantetsu_Civil_Engineering_Projects_desc:0 "While the Japanese have much to benefit directly from large civil engineering projects in Fengtian, they also do so indirectly by helping to present our regime as successful at improving the everyday lives of citizens. In this respect, our interests are mutually shared."
#Crossover Section
FNG_Manufacture_Mingsheng:0 "Manufacture Mingsheng"
FNG_Manufacture_Mingsheng_desc:0 "Back in late 1931 Zhang Zuolin's son, Xueliang, commissioned an American engineer to create China's first automotive vehicle, called 'Mingsheng' or 'people's livelihood'. Fearing compeition to their own vehicles, the Japanese made efforts to interrupt and stall mass-production, but now after many years the pieces have finally fallen into place."
FNG_Fengtian_Society_for_Light_Metals:0 "Fengtian Society for Light Metals"
FNG_Fengtian_Society_for_Light_Metals_desc: "Significant deposits of Bauxite and Alunite have been known to exist in Liaoning for many years, but recent advances by Mantetsu sponsored laboratories in Fushun and Tokyo have enabled Aluminium production via a number of electro-chemical processes."
FNG_Yalu_and_Songhua_Hydroelectricity:0 "Yalu and Songhua Hydroelectricity"
FNG_Yalu_and_Songhua_Hydroelectricity_desc:0 "Manchuria's abundant coal deposits make for an excellent power source, but the powerful currents of the Yalu and Songhua rivers could provide additional power at minimal expense. With Japanese expertise, we might harness these mighty rivers to power more homes and industry."
FNG_Japanese_Coal_Gasification_Methods:0 "Japanese Coal Gasification Methods"
FNG_Japanese_Coal_Gasification_Methods_desc:0 "Japan's quest for crucial oil lead it to Manchria, but now with disappointing results from prospecting, coal gasification seems the only logical path forward. Though energy intensive, Fushun's enormous coal deposits could make the complex processes worthwhile."
FNG_Manchurian_Model_Cities:0 "Manchurian Model Cities"
FNG_Manchurian_Model_Cities_desc:0 "Japan sometimes goes to surprising lengths to portray its role in Fengtian as one of benevolent paternalism, to which end Mantetsu plans to install state of the art electrical, sewer, and tram systems in the major cities of Mukden, Yingkou, Changchun, and Harbin."
#Industrial Development Committee Section
FNG_Found_the_Northeast_IDC: "Found the Northeast IDC"
FNG_Found_the_Northeast_IDC_desc:0 "At Japanese recommendation, a proposal has been put forth to organise several influential businessmen and politicians into a body called the 'Northeastern Industrial Development Committee' that might guide Fengtian's industrial development."
FNG_Expand_the_Anshan_Mines:0 "Expand the Anshan Mines"
FNG_Expand_the_Anshan_Mines_desc:0 "The enormous iron deposits in Anshan have been described as being of 'world class significance', and churn out nearly 7 million tonnes of iron, with the potential to triple output by 1942. This expansion seems likely to propel Anshan toward becoming one of East Asia's largest industrial centres."
FNG_Establish_the_Jinzhou_Industrial_Zone:0 "Establish the Jinzhou Industrial Zone"
FNG_Establish_the_Jinzhou_Industrial_Zone_desc:0 "Jinzhou's docks and strategic position in the 'Liaoxi Corridor', which connects land transportation between North China and Northeast China, make it a prime target for government incentivised development. It remains to be seen whether special rules will be applied to this zone favouring Chinese or Japanese companies."
FNG_Expand_the_Fushun_Mines:0 "Expand the Fushun Mines"
FNG_Expand_the_Fushun_Mines_desc:0 "The mines around Fushun churn out nearly 11 million tons of coal per year, with deposits promising to produce over 4.5 billion tonnes total. While some modern trains and ships in the West use oil, the Japanese Empire runs on coal, and the strategic significance of these mines cannot be understated."
FNG_Yingkou_Commercial_Development:0 "Yingkou Commercial Development"
FNG_Yingkou_Commercial_Development_desc:0 "The port city of Yingkou serves as Fengtian's primary gateway to the world, and the second largest port on the Bohai Gulf after Japanese-controlled Dalian. The tremendous increase in material production in Fengtian demands an equally large investment in commercial infrastructure."
#Develop the Four Provinces Section
FNG_Develop_the_Four_Provinces:0 "Develop the Four Provinces"
FNG_Develop_the_Four_Provinces_desc:0 "The Four Provinces of Manchuria, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, and Inner Manchuria, already contain over 30% of China's railroads and feature relatively widespread heavy industry, but if Fengtian is to move into the future these will have to be expanded upon and improved. Ideally this would be achieved solely by the Chinese people, but reality dictates that the Japanese will lead much of the path forward."
FNG_Reorganize_the_NTC:0 "Reorganise the NTC"
FNG_Reorganize_the_NTC_desc:0 "Founded by the Fengtian Government shortly after its creation, the National Transportation Commission serves as a planning board for infrastructure construction across the country. The Japanese allege that its foremost aim is to disrupt Mantetsu's operations, and there may be at least some truth to this claim."
#Resume the Wang Yongjiang Reforms Section
FNG_Resume_the_Wang_Yongjiang_Reforms:0 "Resume the Wang Yongjiang Reforms"
FNG_Resume_the_Wang_Yongjiang_Reforms_desc:0 "Zhang Zuolin's financial minister for many years, Wang Yongjiang, was almost singlehandedly responsible for the development of Manchuria from a weak borderland into one of China's most prosperous regions. Unfortunately he was taken from us some years ago, but his work and vision live on."
FNG_Centralize_the_Banks:0 "Centralise the Banks"
FNG_Centralize_the_Banks_desc:0 "Fengtian currently features four note-issuing banks, namely the Bank of the Three Eastern Provinces, the Bank of Kirin, the Bank of Heilungkiang and the Frontier Bank, each of which are products of earlier centralisation efforts. Now it seems pertinent to complete this process and unify the banks under a single Central Bank."
FNG_Re-Introduce_the_Fengtian_Dollar:0 "Re-introduce the Fengtian Dollar"
FNG_Re-Introduce_the_Fengtian_Dollar_desc:0 "The Fengtian Dollar was one of Wang Yongjiang's later experiments, and served as a currency un-backed by silver but still payable in tax, demonstrating the government's faith in its value but requiring no extra silver to print. Following enormous government expenditures during the Civil Wars and subsequent inflation, the currency was discontinued, but its flexibility could be useful today."
FNG_Support_Sino-Japanese_Joint_Companies:0 "Support Sino-Japanese Joint Companies"
FNG_Support_Sino-Japanese_Joint_Companies_desc:0 "A great number of businesses in Fengtian offer shares to both Chinese and Japanese, including the infamous Mantetsu, but relatively few Chinese have the funds to invest and ss a result most joint companies are Japanese dominated. Government backing may permit us to provide means and incentives to fellow Chinese and gradually shift this balance."
FNG_Encourage_Chinese_Investment:0 "Encourage Chinese Investment"
FNG_Encourage_Chinese_Investment_desc:0 "Chinese investment is at the heart of our efforts to return at least some control of Fengtian's economy to its people, instead of Mantetsu. Incentives and careful planning are the only way forward."
FNG_Fill_the_Silver_Reserve:0 "Fill the Silver Reserve"
FNG_Fill_the_Silver_Reserve_desc:0 "The Fengtian Yuan, our principal currency, is backed by silver and in the past has even gained value against the Japanese Yen. This has been met by Japanese insistence that our reserves have never held enough silver to properly back the currency. Regrettably, there may have been some truth to this, and so more silver must be purchased if we are to attract additional investment."
FNG_Encourage_Japanese_Investment:0 "Encourage Japanese Investment"
FNG_Encourage_Japanese_Investment_desc:0 "Unfortunately foreign capital is crucial to our development efforts, and so we must make attempts to attract Japanese alongside Chinese investors. While they won't receive the same incentives as our own citizens, they should be comforted by our recent filling of the silver reserves."
#Civil Reform Section
FNG_Reform_the_Civil_Service_Examination:0 "Reform the Civil Service Examination"
FNG_Reform_the_Civil_Service_Examination_desc:0 "In use for well over 2,000 years, the Imperial Civil Service Examination saw only minor reform during the later years of the Qing Dynasty, and is now desperately in need of review in order to form a capable and modern civil service for Fengtian."
FNG_Rural_Reconstruction:0 "Rural Reconstruction"
FNG_Rural_Reconstruction_desc:0 "Disturbed by China's decades of national humiliation, but not moved to the extreme conservatism of the Qing Dynasty or the radicalism of the Kuomintang, the Rural Reconstruction Movement seeks to revive the Chinese village through education, medical aid, and political organisation."
FNG_Soldier-Farmers:0 "Soldier-Farmers"
FNG_Soldier-Farmers_desc:0 "Most of China's wars have been fought by peasant farmers, and while standing armies now exist, their manpower detracts from the economic viability of the state. Few families want to send their sons away if it means having no help on the farm during crucial planting and harvesting seasons. Rotating our deployments to match seasonal changes would go a long way toward solving this problem."
#Political Branch
FNG_Courting_the_Grand_Marshals_Favour:0 "Courting the Grand Marshal's Favour"
FNG_Courting_the_Grand_Marshals_Favour_desc:0 "The Fengtian Government consists of several groups competing for the attention and favour of Grand Marshal Zhang Zuolin, around whom most state functions revolve. The Communications Clique and others in the assembly clamour for a constitution, while the generals call for a return to military rule, but Zhang may instead be able to quell the chaos and replace the squabbling factions with his own iron fist."
#Warlord Section
FNG_Revise_the_Military_Leadership:0 "Revise the Military Leadership"
FNG_Revise_the_Military_Leadership_desc:0 "For several years the military establishment has been divided between old and young factions, its more venerable members veterans of the Civil Wars, and its newer members trained at the Japanese Army War College. Serious conflict has emerged between them, and if progress is to be made, the Grand Marshal must pick a side."
FNG_Empower_the_Warlords:0 "Empower the Warlords"
FNG_Empower_the_Warlords_desc:0 "Until the foundation of the Republic, Zhang Zuolin never possessed complete control over the four provinces. Instead he exercised hegemony over a series of weaker warlords, who were later folded into the new government through a Japanese backed centralisation campaign. These Warlords now serve as Zhang's generals through a semi-feudal leadership structure, but their own ambitions remain."
FNG_The_Generals_Know_Best:0 "The Generals Know Best"
FNG_The_Generals_Know_Best_desc: "The corrupt politicians of the Assembly have allowed Fengtian to meander aimlessly for too long. Only the Grand Marshal and his generals are capable of leading the country forward. It takes the iron mettle of disciplined military men to resist temptations posed by the Japanese and other forces that seek to divide and weaken China!"
FNG_The_Jilin_Incident:0 "The Jilin Incident"
FNG_The_Jilin_Incident_desc:0 "It has become clear that the divide between the Old and Young Guard factions has only widened as a result of their recent ascent to power. Agents loyal to the government have determined that one of the factions is conducting an unexpected military buildup outside Songyuan in Jilin Province. This warrants investigation, and possibly decisive action."
FNG_Establish_the_Supreme_War_Council:0 "Establish the Supreme War Council"
FNG_Establish_the_Supreme_War_Council_desc:0 "With the military unified, and all political obstructions eliminated, the time is right for the establishment of a Supreme War Council to properly lay the foundation for China's prosperity and greatness. With this council of mighty generals at our head, the Fengtian government will be unstoppable!"
#Cult of Personality Section
FNG_A_Father_to_the_People:0 "A Father to the People"
FNG_A_Father_to_the_People_desc:0 "As part of centralisation efforts over the past decade, Zhang Zuolin has been portrayed by the government as a benevolent paternal figure guarding the Chinese people from backward Qing conservatism and western imperialist influences. Continuing this endeavour can only bolster our legitimacy."
FNG_Exalt_the_Grand_Marshal:0 "Exalt the Grand Marshal"
FNG_Exalt_the_Grand_Marshal_desc:0 "The generals and politicians squabble endlessly, and it has become clear that no progress can be made in the shadow of their incompetent leadership. The people, and the state, need guidance which can come from only once source. Let us exalt the Grand Marshal Zhang Zuolin!"
FNG_Formalize_the_Cult_of_Personality:0 "Formalise the Cult of Personality"
FNG_Formalize_the_Cult_of_Personality_desc:0 "We must redouble our efforts to rightfully portray our glorious leader as the man he truly is; a paragon and exemplar to all Chinese. Official state functions and propaganda efforts will be adjusted appropriately."
FNG_Proclaim_a_New_Mandate:0 "Proclaim a new Mandate"
FNG_Proclaim_a_New_Mandate_desc:0 "The people's resolve to do away with Qing regressive nature and western imperialist influences has never been stronger, as exemplified in the Grand Marshal's proclamation today reducing the powers of the Assembly which has long been infested with scheming divisive elements."
FNG_There_is_only_the_Grand_Marshal:0 "There is only the Grand Marshal"
FNG_There_is_only_the_Grand_Marshal_desc:0 "It is time for the Grand Marshal, Zhang Zuolin, sun of China's future and beloved father of the Chinese people, to do away with internal disruptive forces and unite the country under a single banner! Ten thousand years to Grand Marshal Zhang!"
#Constitutional Section
FNG_Reorganize_the_Legislative_Polity:0 "Reorganise the Legislative Polity"
FNG_Reorganize_the_Legislative_Polity_desc:0 "The Assembly, cobbled together from the ashes of the Beiyang Government and other exiled groups from the South, has remained divided and largely impotent since its founding. Its various factions scramble to attract the Grand Marshal's favour, and thus gain a powerful piece in the political game."
FNG_Entrust_the_Assembly:0 "Entrust the Assembly"
FNG_Entrust_the_Assembly_desc:0 "Since the Xinhai Revolution nearly two decades ago, no democratic government in China has successfully drafted and adopted a constitution, and in order to gain the full support of the people in our efforts to retake the South we must entrust the Assembly with this important task."
FNG_The_Autumn_Program:0 "The Autumn Program"
FNG_The_Autumn_Program_desc:0 "On the heels of negotiations last Autumn, influential members of the Recovery League, Communications Clique, and Zhang Clique have set out a program outlining their intent to draft a Constitution. A key point of cooperation is a shared understanding that, without such measures, the government risks losing its way and will never hold the true support of the Chinese people."
FNG_The_Harbin_Convention:0 "The Harbin Convention"
FNG_The_Harbin_Convention_desc:0 "An effective constitution will only come as a product of a convention bringing together all of the major parties, and it goes without saying that some may attempt to disrupt the proceedings. The city of Harbin has been chosen to host the convention, given its long history as a multi-ethnic centre."
FNG_A_Resplendent_Republic:0 "A Reseplendent Republic"
FNG_A_Resplendent_Republic:0 "With the successful creation of a constitution satisfying at least the remaining major players in the government, it now merely needs to be adopted by the Assembly. Surely the way forward is now bright and clear for the Fengtian Government and the Republic of China. Long live democracy long live the Republic!"

#Strengthen the Army Branch
FNG_Strengthen_the_Army:0 "Strengthen the Army"
FNG_Strengthen_the_Army_desc:0 "During the Civil Wars, the Fengtian Army was utterly decimated as a consequence of intense fighting against more modern German equipment and defections by important generals, and the ensuing eight years have seen slow but steady rearmament and reorganisation in-pace with the recovering economy."
#Mukden National Academy Section
FNG_Found_the_Mukden_National_Academy:0 "Found the Mukden National Academy"
FNG_Found_the_Mukden_National_Academy_desc:0 "In the absence of formalised or even organised military instruction, Fengtian officers have long been sent to Japan for an education, and the cost of doing so is relatively prohibitive. As a result, and thanks to Japanese pressure, we have accepted Japanese officers into our lower ranks. This must end."
FNG_Expel_Japanese_Officers:0 "Expel Japanese Officers"
FNG_Expel_Japanese_Officers_desc:0 "Japan's influence over our military is unacceptable, we must expel their officers from our ranks. The cost of making such a move without sufficient replacements could be great, not to mention the diplomatic backlash, so we must make this move carefully."
#Japanese Instruction Column
FNG_Obtain_Japanese_Instructors:0 "Obtain Japanese Instructors"
FNG_Obtain_Japanese_Instructors_desc: "The Japanese field a modern military comparable in strength and discipline with any in the West. Given that the Japanese government is willing to provide instructors free of charge, we should take this opportunity to build an army the Qing will envy."
FNG_Modernized_Curriculum:0 "Modernised Curriculum"
FNG_Modernized_Curriculum_desc:0 "The modern Japanese curriculum, designed to counter Russian aggression on the plains of Manchuria, emphasises morale factors and tenacity of the will, stressing training designed to develop the ability to recognise opportunities for decisive attack; enveloping open enemy flanks, encircling formations, and thus destroying numerically and technologically superior forces."
FNG_Moral_Indoctrination:0 "Moral Indoctrination"
FNG_Moral_Indoctrination_desc:0 "Japanese training emphasises the importance of the human factor in maintaining a continuous offensive, with the belief that spirit can triumph over steel. This requires serious moral indoctrination."
FNG_New_Model_Army:0 "New Model Army"
FNG_New_Model_Army_desc:0 "Our new officer corps are now well schooled in the most modern Japanese strategies and tactics available. Now all that remains is to begin the process of graduation, deployment, and integration with the regular troops."
#Chinese Instruction Column
FNG_Hire_Chinese_Instructors:0 "Hire Chinese Instructors"
FNG_Hire_Chinese_Instructors_desc:0 "The Japanese and Westerners are not the only ones who know how to fight, ample experience in the Civil Wars has produced a class of veterans who excel in unorthodox tactics and know the land better than any foreign officer. Unfortunately, service to the country is not payment enough."
FNG_Lessons_from_the_Civil_War:0 "Lessons from the Civil War"
FNG_Lessons_from_the_Civil_War_desc:0 "The most recent phase of the Civil Wars saw Fengtian troops fighting enemies whose weapons and technology far outclassed their own. Through trials of fire and blood, improvised weapons and unusual methods emerged to suit the new environment, allowing Fengtian soldiers to punch above their weight."
FNG_Ties_of_Loyalty:0 "Ties of Loyalty"
FNG_Ties_of_Loyalty_desc:0 "The Army's leadership structure is virtually feudal, and most of our generals and troops owe their personal loyalty to the Grand Marshal, instead of any abstract concept of state. This has its obvious disadvantages, but strengthening these ties will help to resist Japanese interference."
FNG_Dare_to_Die_Corps:0 "Dare to Die Corps"
FNG_Dare_to_Die_Corps_desc:0 "Revolutionary general Huang Xing said of the Dare to Die Corps 'We must die, so let us die bravely', and so these brave soldiers go into battle with the full expectation of death. While such units have existed for years, we can formalise their organisation and training."
#Chinese Equipment Section
FNG_Standardize_Equipment:0 "Standardise Equipment"
FNG_Standardize_Equipment_desc:0 "The chaos of the past two decades and a century of pervasive Western influence has resulted in the eclectic mix of old, obsolete, and locally produced weapons fielded by many factions. The resulting logistical nightmare requires ammunition for over 100 variants of small arms alone."
FNG_Expand_the_Mukden_Arsenal:0 "Expand the Mukden Arsenal"
FNG_Expand_the_Mukden_Arsenal_desc:0 "China's largest military-industrial enterprise through the 1920s, the Mukden Arsenal produces a wide variety of modified Weltkrieg-era small arms and artillery."

FNG_Develop_the_Marshal_Zhang_Rifle_desc:0 "The time has come for we Chinese to develop a rifle for ourselves, not only to demonstrate our independence from foreign influence, but for practical reasons of self reliance. The new weapon will almost certainly combine features of the German Mauser and Japanese Arisaka rifles, likely closely resembling the latter."
FNG_Study_Japanese_Arms_Manufacture:0 "Study Japanese Arms Manufacture"
FNG_Study_Japanese_Arms_Manufacture_desc:0 "Japan has had an arms industry resembling those in the West for decades, and far outstripping even our own Mukden arsenal. We must learn all they will let us, and more."

FNG_Import_Artillery_from_Kokura:0 "Import Artillery from Kokura"
FNG_Import_Artillery_from_Kokura_desc:0 "Japan's Kokura Arsenal has a long history of producing quality artillery, and importing these more advanced weapons ought to be much faster and cheaper than building more of our own."

FNG_Incentivize_Zaibatsu_Arms_Manufacture_desc:0 "Japan's mighty industrial conglomerates, the Zaibatsu, already operate in Fengtian in competition to Mantetsu and domestic businesses.

#Naval Branch
FNG_The_Navy_of_the_Republic:0 "The Navy of the Republic"
FNG_The_Navy_of_the_Republic_desc:0 "The Navy of the Republic, more commonly referred to as the Fengtian Navy, currently consists of a small collection of cruisers, destroyers, and re-purposed civilian vessels.

### New Fengtian Events ###

fengtian.new.1.t:0 "Huanghanhui Crackdown"
fengtian.new.1.d:0 "The Huanghanhui, or Imperial Han Society, has been found to be using bribes and threats of violence to coerce low-level members of the Assembly. Unfortunately this information has gone public, even as the Assemblymen in question have been removed from office, and local police pursue additional suspects. \n\n Shortly after information regarding this incident was presented to Japanese authorities, Kempeitai agents were observed entering an enclosed compound outside Mukden, and reports indicate gunfire was exchanged. Over a dozen bodies were removed from the premises, and it would be unwise to pursue this matter any further."
fengtian.new.1.a:0 "Troubling"
fengtian.new.2.t:0 "Communications Clique Leads Railroad Strikes"
fengtian.new.2.d:0 "The Communications Clique, with its widespread influence in Chinese-owned Manchurian railroads like the CER, has resorted to encouraging union activity and strikes to compensate for its recent losses of influence in government. The Clique will likely only go so far, for risk of creating something it cannot control, but their methods have already been fairly successful in demonstrating their political and economic clout."
fengtian.new.2.a:0 "Unfortunate but necessary"
#Land Reform Events#
fengtian.new.3.t:0 "Land Disputes in Heilongjiang"
fengtian.new.3.d:0 "As a product of various socio-economic changes, such as the steady shift of seasonal workers from the agricultural north to industrial jobs in Fengtian Province, land disputes have begun to flare up at an alarming rate. Normally these matters would be handled by the local Xiangshen, landlords, retired officials, clan elders, and scholars who 'represent' peasants in meetings with county officials. On this occasion, however, a large collection of peasants have bypassed all local officials and are attempting to petition the government directly. Normally such a petition, unworthy of the central government's attention, would be brushed aside, but unfortunately the situation has attracted the attention of the Asahi Shimbun, a leftist Japanese newspaper. \n\n The local Xiangshen, believing this matter to be solely within their jurisdiction, request that they be allowed to settle the matter themselves, brushing aside accusations of favouritism and corruption by the peasants. On the one hand, throughout all of Chinese history the Central Government has never truly been able to exert influence over the Xiangshen, but on the other the peasants grow increasingly desperate, and the entire region is watching."
fengtian.new.3.a:0 "Support the Xiangshen"
fengtian.new.3.b:0 "Support Local Land Reform"
fengtian.new.4.t:0 "Clamour for Further Land Reform"
fengtian.new.4.d:0 "Despite the government's efforts to resolve the land disputes in the north, the matter has again arisen, the farmers likely emboldened by their predecessors and the publicity they received. The situation is fairly similar, as the Xiangshen once again assert their authority, and the peasants demand increased control over their land and what happens on it. \n\n This petition, however, has double the signatures, and with the results of the last case fresh in their minds, other farmers begin to grumble."
fengtian.new.4.a:0 "Support the Xiangshen"
fengtian.new.4.b:0 "Support Local Land Reform"
fengtian.new.5.t:0 "Land Reform Reaches the Assembly"
fengtian.new.5.d:0 "It is unusual for members of the Recovery League to stray far from their usual statements about southern reclamation, or from the scripts prepared for them by deep-pocketed 'friends', but some more liberal minded members of the Assembly have received a landslide of peasant petitions regarding land reform, and have decided to champion their cause. They argue that if our republican government aims to truly embody the values of the Xinhai Revolution and to differentiate itself from the archaic Qing, it must satisfy the needs of the common people, and strip away the sort of feudalism that the Xiangshen represent. \n\n This group of vocal politicians remains a minority amid an otherwise indifferent Assembly, and advisers warn that the Xiangshen as a whole are not to be trifled with, but this decision ultimately lies in the Marshal's hands."
fengtian.new.5.a:0 "Support the Xiangshen"
fengtian.new.5.b:0 "Support widespread land reform"
#Land Reform Event Conclusions#
fengtian.new.6.t:0 "Peasant Unrest Quelled"
fengtian.new.6.d:0 "Given a taste of land reform, but denied its full flavor, unsatisfied peasants rose up in several northern villages, only to be put down by local garrisons. To add to the sad and embarrassing situation, the commander of a nearby Japanese brigade patrolling the Russian border decided to intervene, adding the impression that foreign influence was behind the crackdown, and that the central government is incapable of keeping order without outside assistance. \n\n This situation might have been handled better."
fengtian.new.6.a:0 "Damnable peasants!"
fengtian.new.7.t:0 "Widespread Peasant Unrest Quelled"
fengtian.new.7.d:0 "Given a taste of land reform, but denied its full flavor, unsatisfied peasants rose up across the north, overwhelming local garrisons and posing a threat to to the regional command at Qihihar. Fortunately the lightly armed farmers were poorly organised, lacking any kind of leadership structure, and so upon the full deployment of the regional general's forces, the attackers were dispersed and many slaughtered. \n\n Unfortunately, however, the loose discipline of the troops turned mere securing of towns into a looting frenzy, which was soon joined by nearby Japanese troops who apparently felt themselves 'under threat'. Our soldiers have been disciplined, but the damage has been done, and it is difficult to understate the current ill-will held toward the central government. The Xiangshen, smugly assured of their correctness all along, are happy to wait before re-asserting their authority to let the pain and embarrassment fully sink in."
fengtian.new.7.a:0 "What a disaster!"
fengtian.new.8.t:0 "Land Reform Underway"
fengtian.new.8.d:0 "For better or worse, land reform is now underway at both the local and national levels, with officials superseding the local Xiangshen to assert the central government's sovereignty for the first time in hundreds of years. However, while they have used that time to thoroughly game the machine of local administration, they were also its designers and engineers, forcing officials to proverbially re-invent the wheel. While many are satisfied, the economy is certain to suffer considerably, and it is unclear just how far the reforms will be able to go."
fengtian.new.8.a:0 "This is the price of progress"
#The Fate of Mantetsu Schooling#
fengtian.new.9.t:0 "The Fate of Mantetu Schooling"
fengtian.new.9.d:0 "Mantetsu has long maintained a series of privately run schools originally intended for the sons and daughters of employees, as well as Japanese immigrants, which pride themselves on providing an education comparable to or even exceeding those available in the Home Islands. At the Japanese government's behest, these schools were more recently opened to the paying public, clearly as part of an attempt to spread Japanese culture and norms. However, the schools are crucial to education, not only because many children of Fengtian's wealthy are enrolled, but also because they provide their services at no government cost. \n\n Any attempt to close the Mantetsu schools to the public will be met not only with Japanese outrage, but a state of educational chaos as we try to pick up the slack. While the civil service has undergone reforms, it remains questionable as to whether our economy and domestic educational staff will be up to the challenge."
fengtian.new.9.a:0 "Close the schools"
fengtian.new.9.b:0 "There is no choice"
fengtian.new.10.t:0 "The Kimono Scandal"
fengtian.new.10.d:0 "Scandal! In a most unfortunate turn of events, the Grand Marshal's youngest daughter has been photographed wearing a Japanese Kimono during a photo-session at the Mantetsu-run 'Hokutou Kunitachidaigaku' or 'Northeast National Academy'. Despite risk of arrest, word of the photo has already spread widely, along with a few copies of the image itself, though local and national news agencies know better than to print this defamation. Some agents in the military's intelligence branch speculate that the image was intentionally taken and spread by the Japanese as a means of punishing the government for recent actions, but no supporting evidence has emerged. \n\n There is little question, however, that the Qing will use this opportunity to spread their nefarious propaganda."
fengtian.new.10.a:0 "What an embarrassment!"
fengtian.new.10.b:0 "Close the Mantetsu schools!"
fengtian.new.11.t:0 "Students Join the Youth League"
fengtian.new.11.d:0 "In an embarassing and deeply damaging incident, a band of Chinese school children from Changchun recently announced their intention to join the Fengtian Youth League, which actively promotes Japanese interests in our country. Obviously their young minds are easily impressionable, but their parade through the streets of their home city, waving Japanese flags, has disgusted many, and invited outright enmity toward themselves and the government. Parents weep, asking how their children could become so warped, and demand an alternative to these dangerous Japanese-run schools."
fengtian.new.11.a:0 "This is an outrage!"
fengtian.new.11.b:0 "Close the schools!"
fengtian.new.12.t:0 "Chinese Uniforms for Chinese Students"
fengtian.new.12.d:0 "After some time and effort, as well as considerable expense, several new Chinese-run schools have pooled their resources to produce a new standard uniform for our students. While this may seem like a small change, the uniforms are a symbol of Chinese independence, as well as a disciplined and modern society. Surely a bright new future awaits!"

#NTC Railway Construction#
fengtian.new.13.t:0 "Building the Jilin-Hailong Line"
fengtian.new.13.d:0 "With the reorganisation of the Northeast Transportation Committee complete, several new railways have been proposed for construction and, in some cases, completion. The first major project is the Jilin-Hailong Railway, originally planned in 1927, which met serious delays in construction due to the eruption of war in the south, and concerted Japanese attempts to stall construction. The line has been operating in limited capacity since 1931, but remains incomplete, with both Mantetsu and a collection of smaller Chinese companies vying for the contract to continue building. The Japanese claim, and perhaps correctly, that they could have the railway complete in half the time due to their resources and expertise, but choosing a Chinese company would do a great deal to demonstrate Chinese strength and independence."
fengtian.new.13.a:0 "Choose a Chinese Company"
fengtian.new.13.b:0 "Choose Mantetsu"
fengtian.new.14.t:0 "The Jilin-Hailong Line is Complete"
fengtian.new.14.d:0 "After months of construction and various unfortunate delays, the Jilin-Hailong line is finally complete, extending the reach of our main rail system into areas otherwise difficult to access. After some review of plans and available resources, the NTC will undoubtedly prepare to issue another contract."
fengtian.new.14.a:0 "Great news!"
fengtian.new.15.t:0 "Building the Changchun-Dailai Line"
fengtian.new.15.d:0 "Proposed by the Japanese as part of a wider project to connect Mantetsu's smaller provincial lines with central lines running through major cities, the Changchun-Dalai line should serve to increase the movement speeds of men and materials significantly from north to south. While the line does have Japanese origins and would serve to extend Mantetsu's reach, NTC planners nonetheless note its practical value, and suggest that it be built anyway. As before, Mantetsu offers to carry out the construction process themselves, but Chinese companies stand ready to perform the same task."
fengtian.new.15.a:0 "Choose a Chinese Company"
fengtian.new.15.b:0 "Choose Mantetsu"
fengtian.new.16.t:0 "The Changchun-Dailai Line is Complete"
fengtian.new.16.d:0 "The new Changchun-Dailai line now stands as the most modern in China, taking full advantage of more recent technologies, and visually demonstrating the sheer gap in time between the older lines originating in the 1920s. Truly, the Chinese nation is moving toward a brighter future."
fengtian.new.16.a:0 "Excellent!"
fengtian.new.17.t:0 "Building the Taonan-Suolun Line"
fengtian.new.17.d:0 "The final of the NTC's more major construction projects is the Taonan-Suolun Line, which like other recent constructions, serves to connect major lines to otherwise difficult to reach areas. Unlike the previous line, however, this will connect directly to the Chinese Eastern Railway, theoretically keeping Mantetsu's creeping influence further from its operations. All the same, Mantetsu offers to construct the railroad, likely hoping to salvage at least something from the situation."
fengtian.new.17.a:0 "Choose a Chinese Company"
fengtian.new.17.b:0 "Choose Mantetsu"
fengtian.new.18.t:0 "Railway Construction Workers Strike!"
fengtian.new.18.d:0 "Chinese workers, complaining of inadequate pay and difficult working conditions, have refused to return to work in a carefully coordinated strike. Despite the presence of railway unions in the Northeast, their coordination in this instance suggests the involvement of the Communications Clique, possibly as part of an attempt to demonstrate their influence or retaliate for some perceived slight. While this turn of events effects them too, the Japanese are happy to watch us squabble amongst ourselves, and the strike will end, but not without causing significant delays."
fengtian.new.18.a:0 "Unfortunate"
fengtian.new.19.t:0 "Delays Plague Railway Construction"
fengtian.new.19.d:0 "The nature of the situation was fairly clear as soon as the first signs appeared; shipments that seemed to unaccountably go missing for several days on end, rails laid at just enough of an incorrect angle to require complete re-construction, and sudden inspections of the labor force by Japanese agents supposedly seeking 'dangerous criminals', inspections which inevitably require the suspension of work. These same tactics were employed by the Japanese during the 1920s against the Fengtian Clique's railway projects, attempting to slow and discredit native railway construction in order to limit competition to Mantetsu, and now they seem to be delaying our efforts once again. Unfortunately, there is little we can do. "
fengtian.new.19.a:0 "Frustrating"
fengtian.new.20.t:0 "Delays Plague Mantetsu Railway Construction"
fengtian.new.20.d:0 "Despite Mantetsu's excellent engineers and equipment, the current railway construction project has encountered repeated delays as workers unaccountably go missing, materials vanish in the night, and bandits raid the camps alongside the rails, only to disappear before Japanese troops arrive. The local police and our intelligence services are unwilling to do much to investigate or solve these repeated incidents, instead preferring to watch the Japanese squirm. The fact that Mantetsu received the contract to build the railway is well known to the public, and some patriotic citizens appear to have taken matters into their own hands."

fengtian.informalempire.2.t:0 "Preservation of the Xinhai Order"
fengtian.informalempire.2.d:0 "Fengtian is the sole standing government upholding the order established by the Xinhai Revolution in 1911, which called for the overthrow of the Qing and the establishment of a Republic. Although some say that our republican commitments are questionable, and full scale war against the restored Qing is currently unrealistic, the government loudly advocates both goals, as they foster legitimacy in the eyes of all Chinese."
fengtian.informalempire.2.a:0 "Defend the revolutionary values!"
fengtian.informalempire.3.t:0 "Mantetsu Influence"
fengtian.informalempire.3.d:0 "The South Manchuria Railway Company, colloquially Mantetsu, has long dominated large sectors of Fengtian's economy, and in turn acts as Japan's primary means of influence over the government. While this influence is unwelcome, it brings crucial capital and technology without which the Grand Marshal could never hope to retake China."
fengtian.informalempire.3.a:0 "A necessary evil"
fengtian.informalempire.4.t:0 "Pervasive Mantetsu Influence"
fengtian.informalempire.4.d:0 "Our factories rumble with activity, churning out weapons, supplies, and every-day conveniences at an astounding rate. None of this would be possible without Japan, but whispers of discontent abound. Who are we fighting for, China or Japan? Is the Republic really being strengthened, or instead brought to its knees by foreign exploitation? Is this truly necessary?"
fengtian.informalempire.4.a:0 "How much further can this go?"
fengtian.informalempire.5.t:0 "Mantetsu Dominance"
fengtian.informalempire.5.d:0 "Japanese expertise and Mantetsu's influence propels Fengtian forward in ways previously thought impossible, but for all intents and purposes most meaningful control has passed from the hands of the Assembly to Japan. The Grand Marshal, for better or worse, stands alone before Mantetsu's overwhelming power in the country. It will be up to him to determine the path forward, if there is even one to be found, even as the legitimacy of the government collapsed about him."
