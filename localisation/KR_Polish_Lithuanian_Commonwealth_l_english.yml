### Events ###
plcommon.1.t:0 "The New Prime Minister"
plcommon.1.d:0 "As the foundation of the Commonwealth is now complete, it is now time to decide who will become the Prime Minister."
plcommon.1.a:0 "Janusz Radziwill, the leader of the aristocrats"
plcommon.1.b:0 "Stanislaw Narutowicz, the leader of the conservatives"
plcommon.1.c:0 "Juozas Ambrazevicius, the Lithuanian historian"
plcommon.1.e:0 "Let the people vote for the Prime Minister"
plcommon.2.t:0 "The Capital"
plcommon.2.d:0 "With the rebirth of the Commonwealth we must decide where our capital should be. Historically the Commonwealth was based in Warsaw, but Vilnius could also be used. However, the intense arguments between the Poles and Lithuanians have left many wondering if a compromise is not the best solution. The idea of a new capital has gained popular support recently, and the idea has taken hold. Which city shall become our capital?"
plcommon.2.a:0 "Lublin!"
plcommon.2.b:0 "Siauliai!"
plcommon.2.c:0 "Bialystok!"

plcommon.3.c:0 "Antoni Szylling, School of Defence"
plcommon.4.t:0 "Language question"
plcommon.4.d:0 "Our policy on the official language of the Commonwealth has to be formed. While varying areas speak Polish or Lithuanian, we need to decide the working language of our government. Polish is the obvious choice, as the majority of our nation speaks it, but bilingualism would satisfy the Lithuanian minority who are afraid of Polish domination. What should we do?"
plcommon.4.a:0 "The government will be bilingual!"
plcommon.4.b:0 "Use only Polish for the government"
plcommon.5.t:0 "Dmowski's Speech"
plcommon.5.d:0 "Roman Dmowski, leader of Polish National-Radical Party, recently said that the status of bilingualism is an abomination for Poles. He has encouraged people to destroy all signs with this 'peasant dialect' on them."

plcommon.7.t:0 "National Armed Forces"
plcommon.7.d:0 "Roman Dmowski said that the National-Radical Party, a paramilitary organisation created a few months ago, has to begun to fight against the 'government under Jewish and Lithuanian peasant influence, which threatens the Polish nation.' The number of his supporters is growing very fast."
plcommon.7.a:0 "Smash those rebels"
plcommon.8.t:0 "Dmowski is dead!"
plcommon.8.d:0 "Dmowski, who has been a thorn in our side by setting up opposition against the Commonwealth, was killed in one of clashes between the army and his men. His death has sparked a fire of Polish nationalism, this is not going to end well."
plcommon.8.a:0 "Damn it..."
plcommon.9.t:0 "March of the National-Radicals"
plcommon.9.d:0 "After Dmowski's death, Adam Doboszynski took leadership of the National-Radical Party and organised a march to the capital of the Commonwealth, demanding both punishment for the murderers of Dmowski and a government lead by himself and his supporters. The situation is very dire, there are thousands of supporters of the National-Radical Party in the capital. What should we do?"
plcommon.9.a:0 "We cannot oppose them, Doboszynski is the new prime minister"
plcommon.9.b:0 "Crush them!"
plcommon.10.t:0 "Doboszynski's coup!"
plcommon.10.d:0 "After our refusal to their demands, the Polish nationalists have made an attempt to take power into their hands. Only our armed forces can save us now...."
plcommon.10.a:0 "Doboszynski's coup was a success!"
plcommon.10.b:0 "The armed forces crushed this rebellion!"
plcommon.11.t:0 "New Government"
plcommon.11.d:0 "The National-Radical Party took power in the Commonwealth and has restored Poland."
plcommon.11.a:0 "Okay."
plcommon.12.t:0 "Nationalists takeover in the Commonwealth!"
plcommon.12.d:0 "Today the rightful King of the Commonwealth of Poland and Lithuania, Mindaugas III, was captured by Adam Doboszynski and his Polish nationalist henchmen. Doboszynski officially withdrew the Commonwealth from Mitteleuropa and declared that the Commonwealth is now free from 'German domination.' We need to respond to this crisis immediately, so what should we do?"
plcommon.12.a:0 "There is nothing we can do..."
plcommon.12.b:0 "Such betrayal will not be tolerated!"
plcommon.13.t:0 "The Sejim Elections"
plcommon.13.d:0 "Under our constitution, elections must be held every four years. There are four main political parties that have a chance of winning at the ballot box, who will it be?"
plcommon.13.a:0 "The Patriotic Party"
plcommon.13.b:0 "The People's Coalition"
plcommon.13.c:0 "The National-Radical Party of Poland"

plcommon.19.t:0 "Status of Galicia"
plcommon.19.d:0 "With the reunification process of our countries complete, we can finally intensify our efforts to reclaim vital parts of our homeland. The lands of Galicia-Lodomeria were part of our country. Now, they are under the direct control of Vienna. We can try to bring back Galicia-Lodomeria through direct negotiations with Vienna."
plcommon.19.a:0 "Start talks in Vienna"
plcommon.19.b:0 "We don't need that"
plcommon.20.t:0 "Commonwealth asks about Galicia"
plcommon.20.d:0 "The lands of Galicia-Lodomeria were part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Now, that it has been reformed, they have claimed that region, demanding the transfer of Galicia-Lodomeria in exchange for a large amount of industrial goods, money, and a treaty of mutual protection and recognition of borders."
