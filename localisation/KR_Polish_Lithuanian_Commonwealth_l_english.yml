plcommon.8.t:0 "Dmowski is dead!"
plcommon.8.d:0 "Dmowski, who has been a thorn in our side by setting up opposition against the Commonwealth, was killed in one of clashes between the army and his men. His death has sparked a fire of Polish nationalism, this is not going to end well."

plcommon.9.t:0 "March of the National-Radicals"
plcommon.9.d:0 "After Dmowski's death, Adam Doboszynski took leadership of the National-Radical Party and organised a march to the capital of the Commonwealth, demanding both punishment for the murderers of Dmowski and a government lead by himself and his supporters.

plcommon.12.b:0 "Such betrayal will not be tolerated!"
plcommon.13.t:0 "The Sejim Elections"
