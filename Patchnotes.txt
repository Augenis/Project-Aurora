### Incomplete Content ###
We thought you couldn’t wait any longer for 0.3...
The following trees sadly couldn’t be finished in time, so have had their groundwork added, and will be finished and activated at a later date:
*Ethiopia
*Ireland
*Legation Cities
*USA and associated revolters
*Qing and Republic of China decisions have been moved to a WIP focus tree, full focus trees coming later
*The rework of the German focus tree isn’t done, and again, will be added at a later date, but some minor changes have been added in the meantime
*Siamese custom technological GFX were causing too many errors and couldn’t get fixed in time so has been removed, will be redone and added back again later
*A few changes from HOI4 1.3.3 couldn’t be ported across in time (Russian infrastructure changes for example), will be added later
*A few minor bugs haven’t been fixed, but they are all just typos, cosmetic or missing gfx...with the exception of:
*Puppets are still not peacing out correctly, we have been trying really hard to fix this one, but aren’t 100% sure we have been successful, so any saves with this bug would be priceless

### Bug Fixes ###
Note this isn’t a complete list, it is really hard to record every single bug we fix. That being said most should be here, but don’t lose heart if a bug you reported isn’t listed here.
